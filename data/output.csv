rs6983267,37525664,Evaluating the association of rs6983267 polymorphism of the CCAT2 gene with thyroid cancer susceptibility in the Iranian Azeri population.,"Thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy of the endocrine system. LncRNAs play critical role in various cellular processes and are associated with several diseases. CCAT2 is a lncRNA molecule overexpressed in thyroid cancer. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in CCAT2 gene can cause changes in the structure and function of CCAT2 transcripts and susceptibility to several diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the association of rs6983267 in CCAT2 gene with thyroid cancer susceptibility in the Azeri population of Iran. In this ""case-control"" study, genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of 102 individuals affected by thyroid cancer and 103 healthy individuals as controls. Genotyping was performed using TETRA-ARMS polymerase chain reaction. Statistical analysis showed no significant association between genotypes and/or alleles with the occurrence of thyroid cancer in the studied population, patients' gender, and tumor type. Nevertheless, we found that the allelic and genotypic distribution of this SNP was associated with the size of thyroid tumors in patients. It is assumed that investigating more individuals from both case and control group may further determine the genotypic and allelic frequencies of this SNP locus in Iranian-Azeri population.","tumor, cancer, disease","Evaluating the association of rs6983267 polymorphism of the CCAT2 gene with thyroid cancer susceptibility in the Iranian Azeri population.

A case-control study conducted on 31 patients diagnosed with CRC and 30 healthy controls age and sex-matched with the patients. Real time PCR was used to determine the genotypes of rs7903146, rs698267, rs1696981. We observed no association between rs6983267 and rs16969681 polymorphism and risk of CRC and low association between TCF7L2, rs7903146, polymorphism and risk of CRC. The recessive model of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 had an OR of 1.6 (95% CI 0.058-4.414, P < .05) which means that TT genotype increased the risk and possibility of development of CRC.

rs6983267,35814404,"Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms of EXOC1, BCL2, CCAT2, and CARD8 Genes and Susceptibility to Cervical Cancer in the Northern Chinese Han Population.","Cervical cancer (CC) is one of the main malignant tumors that threaten the health and lives of women around the world, and its morbidity and mortality rate ranks fourth. At present, most studies on the genetic background of CC focus on genetic polymorphisms. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are considered clinically as potential diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for a variety of tumors. Therefore, we aimed to explore the association between SNPs in different genes (EXOC1 gene, BCL2 gene, CCAT2 gene and CARD8 gene) and susceptibility to CC. This study is a case-control study based on women in northern Chinese, which included 492 women with CC and 510 healthy women. This study used multiplex PCR combined with next-generation sequencing to genotype the selected SNPs (rs13117307(C/T) in EXOC1 gene, rs2279115(C/A) in BCL2 gene, rs6983267(G/T) in CCAT2 gene and rs7248320(G/A) in CARD8 gene). The results of the study showed that there was no significant association between the four SNPs and the susceptibility to CC. However, in further stratified analysis, we found that rs13117307 and rs2279115 were significantly related to squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) levels in women with CC, and rs6983267 was significantly related to the menopausal status of women with CC. Specifically, alleles T of rs13117307 and genoytpe AA of rs2279115 when SCC-Ag is greater than 1.5 ng/ml increase the risk of CC. The genotype TG/TG+TT of rs6983267 increases the risk of CC in premenopausal women.

Additionally, we emphasize CCAT2's role as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for multiple tumor suppressor miRNAs, such as miR-4496, miR-493, miR-424, miR-216b, miR-23b, miR-34a, miR-145, miR-200b, and miR-143 and the pro-tumorigenic role of the altered regulatory axis. Additionally, due to its upregulation in tumor tissues, wide distribution across cancer types, and presence in serum samples, we outline CCAT2's potential as a biomarker and disease indicator and its implications for the development of resistance against current cancer therapy regiments and metastasis. Colon cancer-associated transcript 2 (CCAT2) is an intensively studied lncRNA with important regulatory roles in cancer. As such, cumulative studies indicate that CCAT2 displays a high functional versatility due to its direct interaction with multiple RNA binding proteins, transcription factors, and other species of non-coding RNA, especially microRNA.

One single nucleotide polymorphism that is associated with ovarian cancer in this region is rs6983267, located within the long non-coding RNA colon cancer associated transcript 2 (CCAT2). The aim of the present study was to assess the association between rs6983267 and clinical outcomes in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). The present retrospective genetic association study utilized Sanger sequencing to determine the genotype at the rs6983267 locus (GG, GT, TT) in 98 patients with HGSOC. Survival time and chemotherapy responses between patients were compared with the TT genotype and patients with a genotype containing a G allele (GT, GG). Survival analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard ratio analysis. Association with chemo-response was performed using a logistic regression. The results revealed that patients with HGSOC and the TT genotype at the rs6983267 locus had improved survival time compared with patients with genotypes containing a G allele [hazard ratio=0.59; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.36-0.97; P=0.039] and were significantly associated with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage [odds ratio (OR)=5.34; 95% CI, 1.50-22.62; P=0.014] and positive chemo-response (OR=4.51; 95% CI, 1.40-18.00; P=0.018).

In this study, we present a duplex probe-directed recombinase amplification (duplex-PDRA) assay that can perform real-time detection of two SNPs (rs6983267 and rs1447295) in four reactions in two tubes at 39°C within 30 min. The sensitivity of duplex-PDRA was 2×103-104 copies per reaction and no cross-reactivity was observed. A total of 382 clinical samples (179 prostate cancer patients and 203 controls) from northern China were collected and tested by duplex-PDRA assay and direct sequencing. The genotyping results were completely identical. In addition, the association analysis of two SNPs with prostate cancer risk and bone metastasis was conducted. We found that the TT genotype of rs6983267 (OR: 0.42; 95%CI: 0.23-0.78; P=0.005) decreased the risk of prostate cancer, while the CA genotype of rs1447295 (OR: 1.89; 95%CI: 1.20-2.96; P=0.005) increased the risk of prostate cancer. However, no association between the two SNPs (rs6983267 and rs1447295) and bone metastasis in prostate cancer was found in this study (P>0.05). In conclusion, the duplex-PDRA assay is an effective method for the simultaneous detection of two SNPs and shows great potential for widespread use in research and clinical settings.",High

The SMAD7 gene encodes an intracellular protein, which inhibits the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway, thereby having a key role in the control of neoplastic processes in various organs. The CHI3L1 gene encodes glycoprotein YKL-40, which plays a role in cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, and angiogenesis. The present study aimed to evaluate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) SMAD7 rs4939827 and CHI3L1 rs4950928, as well as circulating TGFβ-1 and YKL-40 levels with CRC in an Egyptian population of 77 CRC patients and 36 healthy controls. Polymorphisms in the SMAD7 rs4939827 and the CHI3L1 rs4950928 genes were determined using the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Both the SMAD7 rs4939827 TT genotype and the CHI3L1 rs4950928 C allele were associated with the rectal but not the colon cancer. In addition, the C allele of both SMAD7 rs4939827 and CHI3L1 rs4950928 was associated with increased serum levels of TGF-β1 and YKL-40, respectively. In conclusion, our data suggest that SMAD7 rs4939827 and CHI3L1 rs4950928 SNPs have no significant association with CRC.

A polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique was employed to analyze the MTHFR variations, specifically at rs1801133 and rs1801131. Overall, rs1801131 followed both codominant and dominate models, in which in the codominant model, GG [OR (95% CI) 0.11 (0.022-0.553)] and TG [OR (95% CI) 0.106 (0.021-0.528)] predict responders compared to the TT genotype; meanwhile, for the dominate model, the presence of both GG and TG genotypes [OR (95% CI) 0.108 (0.023-0.507)] together predict responders compared to the TT genotype. The Ars1801133Grs1801131 haplotype was significantly associated with responders [OR (95% CI): 0.388 (0.208-0.723)], while the Grs1801133Trs1801131 haplotype was associated marginally with nonresponders [OR (95% CI) 1.980 (0.965-4.064)]. In the final multivariate analysis, GG/TGrs1801131 genotypes were independently related to responders after adjustment for patients, disease, and treatment characteristics, while TTrs1801131 genotypes were associated with nonresponders. The Iraqi RA patients showed genetic polymorphism in MTHFR gene rs1801131 with T carrier allele associated with nonresponders to MTX therapy. The rs1801131 followed both codominant and dominant models. The G-carried allele for rs1801131 showed an independent association with responder to MTX therapy after adjustment for patients, disease, and treatment characteristics.",High
rs1801133,38896027,Homocysteine concentration in coronary artery disease and severity of coronary lesions.,"Our previous study reckons that the impact of the rs1801133 variant of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) on coronary artery disease (CAD) is possibly mediated by cardiometabolic disorder. This study is performed to verify this hypothesis. Four hundred and thirty CAD patients and 216 CAD-free individuals were enrolled in this case-control study. The rs1801133 variant was genotyped by PCR-RFLP. Severity of coronary lesions was evaluated by number of stenotic coronary vessels and extent of coronary stenosis. The rs1801133 T allele significantly increased homocysteine levels in patients with CAD and CAD-free individuals. Individuals with the T allele of rs1801133 had an increased risk of developing CAD. In contrast, individuals with the TT genotype of rs1801133 were at high risk of multiple vessel lesions. The carriers of CT genotype had higher levels of systolic blood pressure (SBP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and lower levels of apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) than those with CC genotype in male patients with CAD. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and precision-recall (PR) curve indicated that hyperhomocysteinemia was sensitive to predict the severity of CAD. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that homocysteine, rs1801133, age, smoking, weight, body mass index (BMI), lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], and hs-CRP were independent risk factors for CAD. The increased risk of CAD and severity of coronary lesions associated with rs1801133 in the Chinese Han population were attributed, at least partly, to high homocysteine levels.

rs1801133,38332006,Epigenetic role of LINE-1 methylation and key genes in pregnancy maintenance.,"Spontaneous abortion is a pregnancy complication characterized by complex and multifactorial etiology. About 5% of childbearing women are globally affected by early pregnancy loss (EPL) and most of them experience recurrence (RPL). Epigenetic mechanisms and controlled inflammation are crucial for pregnancy maintenance and genetic predispositions may increase the risk affecting the maternal-fetal crosstalk. Combined analyses of global methylation, inflammation and inherited predispositions may contribute to define pregnancy loss etiopathogenesis. LINE-1 epigenetic regulation plays crucial roles during embryo implantation, and its hypomethylation has been associated with senescence and several complex diseases. By analysing a group of 230 women who have gone through pregnancy interruption and comparing those experiencing spontaneous EPL (n = 123; RPL, 54.5%) with a group of normal pregnant who underwent to voluntary interruption (VPI, n = 107), the single statistical analysis revealed significant lower (P < 0.00001) LINE-1 methylation and higher (P < 0.0001) mean cytokine levels (CKs: IL6, IL10, IL17A, IL23) in EPL.

About 5% of childbearing women are globally affected by early pregnancy loss (EPL) and most of them experience recurrence (RPL). Epigenetic mechanisms and controlled inflammation are crucial for pregnancy maintenance and genetic predispositions may increase the risk affecting the maternal-fetal crosstalk. Combined analyses of global methylation, inflammation and inherited predispositions may contribute to define pregnancy loss etiopathogenesis. LINE-1 epigenetic regulation plays crucial roles during embryo implantation, and its hypomethylation has been associated with senescence and several complex diseases. By analysing a group of 230 women who have gone through pregnancy interruption and comparing those experiencing spontaneous EPL (n = 123; RPL, 54.5%) with a group of normal pregnant who underwent to voluntary interruption (VPI, n = 107), the single statistical analysis revealed significant lower (P < 0.00001) LINE-1 methylation and higher (P < 0.0001) mean cytokine levels (CKs: IL6, IL10, IL17A, IL23) in EPL.

Genetic variations in the xenobiotic metabolising cytochrome enzymes; Family 1 Subfamily A Member 1 (CYP1A1) and Family 1 Subfamily B Member 1 (CYP1B1) might play a role in the individual susceptibility to breast cancer and its prognosis. The goal of this study is to estimate the incidence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP1A1 (rs1048943, Ile462VaI, and rs4646903/MSP1) and in CYP1B1 (rs1056836, Leu432Val) genes in patients with breast cancer. This case-control study included 180 female patients with breast cancer and 180 healthy control subjects from Kirkuk/Iraq. Genomic DNA was extracted from venous blood samples and tested for SNPs by the direct DNA sequencing technique.

This study investigates interactions between pairs of those single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their effect on survival above the age of 85 in a sample of 327 Croatian individuals. Although none of the SNPs individually showed a significant effect on survival in this sample, 14 of the 359 interactions tested (between SNPs not in LD) reached the level of nominal significance (p<0.05), showing a potential effect on late-life survival. Notably, SH2B3 rs3184504 interacted with different SNPs near TERC, TP53 rs1042522 with different SNPs located near the CDKN2B gene, and CDKN2B rs1333049 with different SNPs in FOXO3, as well as with LINC02227 rs2149954. The other interaction pairs with a possible effect on survival were FOXO3 rs2802292 and ERCC2 rs50871, IL6 rs1800795 and GHRHR rs2267723, LINC02227 rs2149954 and PARK7 rs225119, as well as PARK7 rs225119 and PTPN1 rs6067484.

About 5% of childbearing women are globally affected by early pregnancy loss (EPL) and most of them experience recurrence (RPL).

This research aimed to investigate the correlation between SNPs at several loci (e.g., GSTP1 rs1695, MTHFR rs1801133, XPC rs2228001, TP53 rs1042522, and ERCC1 rs3212986) and ADRs in patients with gynecologic cancer receiving PPCT. A total of 244 patients with gynecologic cancer who received first-line PPCT were included in this retrospective study. Blood fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect genotypes. Logistic regression, Pearson's Chi-square test, and Fisher's exact test were used to explore the correlations between these SNPs and the occurrence of ADRs. The logistic regression results showed that different genotypes of the five genes had no statistical significance in the overall grade greater than or equal to 3 ADRs. The results of Pearson's Chi-square test showed the same results. On specific adverse reactions, we found that the rs1042522 GG genotype significantly increased the risk of grade greater than or equal to 3 leucopenia compared with the CG and the CC genotypes (p = 0.002). The rs1695 AG genotype showed higher correlation for grade greater than or equal to 3 neutropenia (p = 0.020). The rs2228001 CC genotype also had a higher risk for grade greater than or equal to 3 neutropenia (p = 0.003). This study found that whereas the overall grade greater than or equal to 3 adverse reactions in patients with gynecologic cancer receiving PPCT were not associated with SNPs, specific SNPs (rs1042522 GG, rs1695 AG, and rs2228001 CC) were linked to higher risks of leucopenia and neutropenia, indicating their potential as predictors of hematotoxicity in PPCT-treated patients with gynecologic cancer.",cancer,"Gene polymorphism and prediction of toxicity to platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with gynecologic cancer.

Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to assess the gene polymorphisms associated with IL-6 A/G (rs2069837), IL-10-1082 G/A (rs1800896)], IL28B C/T (rs12979860), IFN-γ +874 A/T (rs2430561), TGF-β 1-509 C/T (rs1800469) and TNF-α-308 G/A promoter (rs1800629) from stored samples of 200 healthy individuals and 300 HCV infected patients. There was a significant association of AG and AA genotypes of IL28B, IFN-γ, TGF-β1, and TNF-α over HCV susceptibility and treatment outcome. However, no association between IL-6 and IL-10 gene polymorphism to HCV susceptibility response to the treatment. The observations indicate IL28B CT, TGF-β1 CT, TT and TNF- AG with AA genotypes influence the cytokine expression, which is related to susceptibility and resistance to HCV infection and combined antiviral therapy.",High

Polymorphisms in the TGFB1 gene have been associated with DR; however, results are still contradictory. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential association between two TGFB1 polymorphisms and DR. This study included 992 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM): 546 patients with DR (cases) and 446 patients without DR and with ≥10 years of DM (controls). The TGFB1 rs1800469 and rs1800470 polymorphisms were genotyped by real-time PCR. Frequency of rs1800469 T/T genotype was higher in controls compared to DR cases (18.3% vs. 12.7%, P= 0.022). This genotype remained associated with protection for DR, adjusting for covariables (OR= 0.604; 95% CI 0.395 - 0.923; P= 0.020, recessive model). The rs1800470 C/C genotype was observed in 25.4% of the controls and 18.0% of the cases (P= 0.015); thus, being associated with protection against DR under the recessive model (OR= 0.589; 95% CI 0.405 - 0.857; P= 0.006), adjusting for covariables.

Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to assess the precise association between TGF-β1 polymorphisms and IS risk. Online databases were searched for themes related to TGF-β1 polymorphisms and ARE risk. Quantitative calculations of odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were performed using 5 genetic models of each variant locus. Heterogeneity tests, cumulative analyses, sensitivity analyses, and publication bias were conducted to examine statistical power. Moreover, changes in the secondary structure and minimum free energy (MFE) were explored using in silico analysis. Nineteen case-control studies were included in our meta-analysis on rs1800468 G>A, rs1800469 C>T, and rs1800470 T>C polymorphisms and IS risk. Overall, only a marginal association was found between the rs1800469 C>T polymorphism and IS risk (T vs C: OR = 1.12, 95%CI = 1.00-1.46, P = .05, I2 = 77.0%). Otherwise, no significant association was observed between the rs1800468 G>A and rs1800470 T>C polymorphisms and IS risk in general and stratified analyses.

Studies have found that interleukin 17 (IL-17) plays a central role in the pathology of OT. However, nucleotide variability in IL17 and interleukin 17 receptor (IL17R) genes has not been characterised in OT. As cytokine gene polymorphisms may influence the expression of these molecules, the aim of this study was to verify whether IL17A (rs2275913), IL17F (rs763780), IL17RA (rs4819554) and IL17RC (rs708567) polymorphisms are associated with OT in a Brazilian population. This study enrolled 214 patients seropositive for T. gondii (110 with OT and 104 without) and 107 controls. Polymorphisms were identified by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, validated by DNA sequencing with chi-square and multivariate analyses being used to assess possible associations between polymorphisms and OT. Logistic regression under the dominant model revealed a protection factor against OT of the C mutant allele of the IL17F (rs763780) polymorphism. The T/C-C/C genotypes were significantly more common in patients without OT compared to those with OT (p value = 0.0066) and controls (p value = 0.014). Findings from this study suggest that the IL17F polymorphism may have an influence in the immunopathology of OT in Brazilian individuals.",,,Low
rs763780,38416662,Association of Interleukin-17A and Interleukin-17F Gene Polymorphisms with Atopic Dermatitis in Chinese Children.,"Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, recurrent inflammatory disease associated with an unbalanced immune response in the upper layers of the skin tissue, mostly starting in childhood. As important factors in gene expression regulation, polymorphisms in interleukin (IL)-17A and IL-17F may be associated with the susceptibility and severity of AD. Methods: Blood samples and clinical information were obtained from 132 patients with AD and 100 healthy children. Using multiplex polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing, five potential single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IL-17A and IL-17F were genotyped in all participants. The relationship between SNPs and susceptibility to or severity of AD was examined by analyzing haplotypes and genetic models. Results: The IL-17A rs3819025 polymorphism was substantially associated with higher AD risk in both the allele model (p = 0.03; odds ratio [OR] = 1.76; confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-2.95) and the dominant model (p = 0.04, OR = 1.85; CI: 1.03-3.33). There was no correlation between AD susceptibility and the IL-17A (rs2275913 and rs4711998) or IL-17F (rs763780 and rs12203736) SNPs (all p > 0.05). Additionally, the five IL-17A and IL-17F SNPs did not significantly differ across the mild-to-moderate and severe subgroups (all p > 0.05). Conclusions: The IL-17A/rs3819025 polymorphism was linked to the development of AD, whereas the IL-17F polymorphism was unrelated to the susceptibility to and severity of AD.

The clinical manifestation of the disease varies widely, ranging from asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome causing death. The immune response mechanisms have an important impact on the fine adjustment between healing and enhanced tissue damage. This study aims to investigate the relationship between the variants of the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN), interleukin 17A (IL17A), and interleukin 17F (IL17F) genes and COVID-19 severity. The study population comprised 202 confirmed COVID-19 cases divided into three groups according to severity.

rs2279744,35359434,The MDM2 Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism T309G Is Associated With the Development of Epimacular Membranes.,"Purpose: To investigate the role of the mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) gene single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) T309G in the development of epimacular membranes (EMMs) by analyzing the genotype distribution and consistency of the polymorphism in paired membrane-blood samples. Methods: This was a cross-sectional genetic association study of patients with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) or EMMs. PVR membranes (PVRMs), internal limiting membranes (ILMs) (PVR-ILMs) and blood samples (PVR-blood) from patients with PVR, and EMMs, EMM-ILMs and EMM-blood from patients with EMMs were collected. The genotype of all samples was determined by Sanger sequencing. Sex composition, mean age, the genotype distribution of MDM2 T309G, the allelic frequency of the MDM2 SNP309 G allele (% G) and the somatic mutation rate at the MDM2 T309G locus (% M) were analyzed and compared. The PVR and healthy Chinese donor groups were used as controls for different comparisons. Results: The EMM group of 62 patients was older than the PVR group of 61 patients by an average of 8.87 years (p < 0.0001), but the two groups were statistically similar in the sex composition (p = 0.1754). Importantly, G allele carriers were at a higher risk of developing EMMs than non-G allele carriers (p = 0.0479; OR = 2.047). Moreover, EMM-blood exhibited a significantly higher % G than blood samples from healthy Chinese donors (EMM-blood: 56.78%, donors: 45.61%; p = 0.0256; OR = 1.567). Regarding membrane-blood consistency, % M was significantly different between PVRMs and EMMs (PVRMs: 2.63%, EMMs: 21.57%; p = 0.0097; OR = 10.18) but not between different types of ILMs (PVR-ILMs: 18.18%, EMM-ILMs: 29.17%; p = 0.6855). Furthermore, EMMs (p = 0.0053; OR = 8.250) and EMM-ILMs (p = 0.0233; OR = 14.40) from patients with preoperative macular holes were more predisposed toward somatic mutations at the MDM2 T309G locus than those from patients without preoperative macular holes. Conclusions: MDM2 T309G is associated with the development of EMMs. Herein, the MDM2 SNP309 G allele is first reported as an associated factor of EMMs in a Chinese population. In addition, EMMs and ILMs are genetically unstable at the MDM2 T309G locus, especially when complicated with preoperative macular holes.",,,Low

Violations of the normal drainage of tissue fluids accompany lymphedema. An important mechanism of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis regulation in tissue fluids is the production and reception of vascular endothelial growth factors in combination with the regulation of matrix metalloproteinases. The aim of the work was to perform: a comparative analysis of some polymorphisms of vascular endothelial growth factor and their receptors and the genes encoding matrix metalloproteinases in two forms of lymphedema; an analysis of the relationship of these genes' polymorphisms with the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors in serum and affected tissues.

Thus, this study is aimed at analyzing the association between VEGF +936C/T polymorphism and the risk of preeclampsia. Methods: To assess the causal relationship, a hospital-based cross-sectional analytical study was carried out among 204 Myanmar pregnant women during the period of January 2018-September 2020. For data collection, a pretested, structured questionnaire was used. Blood samples were collected after obtaining consent, and then we studied the extracted gene by using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 18.0 was used for data management and analysis. Results: The genotype CT variant among preeclamptic women was more than that of non-preeclamptic women (26.5% vs. 18.6%), but not significant (p = 0.180). The risk of preeclampsia among women with CT genotypes was 1.57 times higher than that of women with CC genotypes (OR (95%CI) = 1.57 (0.81, 3.06), p = 0.180). The minor allele frequency of the T allele was 15.2% in preeclamptic women and 9.3% in normal pregnant women. The risk of preeclampsia among T allele carriers is 1.49 times (95%CI = 0.80, 2.77) more than that of C allele carriers (p = 0.211). Among the preeclamptic pregnant women, the frequency of the CT genotype was 26.3% in the severe preeclamptic group and 26.9% in the mild preeclamptic group, while the frequency of the T allele was 13.2% and 13.5%, respectively. The frequency of either CT genotype or T allele was more or less the same in both groups, and there was no association between VEGF C/T polymorphism and the severity of preeclampsia. After logistic regression analysis on VEGF genotype and clinical parameters such as age, maternal body mass index (BMI), and neonatal birth weight, the risk of preeclampsia was 2.1 times higher in pregnant women with CT genotype compared to CC genotype (adjusted OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 0.9-4.5, p value -0.057). Conclusion: There was no significant association between VEGF +936C/T polymorphism (rs3025039) and preeclampsia among Myanmar pregnant women. However, the findings of this study highlighted that individuals carrying either the CT genotype or the T allele are at a heightened risk of developing preeclampsia.

We systematically reviewed literature from the Cochrane Library database, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and the Wanfang Data Information Service platform to gather relevant case-control studies. Using odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI), we analyzed the data to assess potential correlations. Sensitivity analysis and the Egger's test were employed to ensure the results stability and to evaluate potential publication bias. Additionally, trial sequential analysis (TSA) was conducted to validate the findings. Our meta-analysis incorporated ten studies involving 2817 patients and 2855 controls. Results indicated that the AA genotype of VEGFA-1154 (rs1570360) is associated with a reduced risk of RA in the overall population (AG + GG vs AA: P = 0.032 OR = 1.932 95% CI 1.059-3.523).

Subgroup analysis revealed a significant association between the VEGF rs3025039(C936) variant and RA risk in the PCR-RFLP group under the TC vs. CC model. TSA confirmed the sufficiency of the sample size for robust conclusions. These findings suggest that the G allele of VEGFA-1154 (rs1570360) may increase RA risk, whereas the A allele appears to confer a protective effect.

In this study we aimed at investigating single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CoRSIVs and their involvement with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) risk. We analyzed 29,099 CoRSIV-SNPs and 133,615 CoRSIV-mQTLs in 14,394 cases and 247,022 controls of European and Asian descent. We observed that the A allele of the rs2976395 SNP was associated with increased PDAC risk in Europeans (p = 2.81 × 10-5). This SNP lies in the prostate stem cell antigen gene and is in perfect linkage disequilibrium with a variant (rs2294008) that has been reported to be associated with risk of many other cancer types.

rs2294008,38464340,The landscape of 8q24 cytoband in gastric cancer (Review).,"Worldwide, gastric cancer (GC) is estimated to be the fifth most common type of cancer type in both sexes, ranking sixth for new cases, with >640,850 cases per year, and fourth in terms of mortality rate. Cancer presents numerical and structural alterations in chromosomes, often through gains and losses of regions. In GC, there are multiple genetic alterations, in which those located in cytoband 8q24 have been frequently described; essential genes are present in this cytoband, regulating the homeostasis of crucial biological processes, such as the MYC gene, which induces expression of selective genes to promote cell growth and proliferation. Conversely, DNA sequence variations can also occur when a single nucleotide in the genome sequence is altered, and this is termed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). These alterations, which can serve as a biological marker, are present in at least 1% of the population and assist in identifying genes associated with GC. In the present review, 12 genes present in cytoband 8q24 related to GC (NSMCE2, PCAT1, CASC19, CASC8, CCAT2, PRNCR1, POU5F1B, PSCA, JRK, MYC, PVT1 and PTK2) are discussed. The PSCA gene was cited more frequently than others; it has four known SNPs associated with GC (rs2978980, rs2294008, rs2976392 and rs9297976).

The C-C-A haplotype, whereby the first C is located at rs2294008 of PSCA and is a low risk allele for gastric cancer, has become a target of positive selection in Asia. Conversely, the C-A-G haplotype carrying the same C allele has become a selection target mainly in Africa. However, Asian and African share both haplotypes, consistent with the haplotype divergence time (170 kya) prior to the out-of-Africa dispersal. The frequency of C-C-A/C-A-G is 0.344/0.278 in Asia and 0.209/0.416 in Africa. Two-dimensional site frequency spectrum analysis revealed that the extent of intra-allelic variability of the target haplotype is extremely small in each local population, suggesting that C-C-A or C-A-G is under ongoing hard sweeps in local populations. From the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of selected haplotypes, the onset times of positive selection were recent (3-55 kya), concurrently with population subdivision from a common ancestor. Additionally, estimated selection coefficients from ABC analysis were up to ~3%, similar to those at other loci under recent positive selection.

FST ≈ 0.26 at this single nucleotide polymorphism is one of the highest between JPT and the genetically close Han Chinese in Beijing (CHB).

We found that haplotypes harboring the C allele are composed of two subhaplotypes. We detected that positive selection on both subhaplotypes has occurred in the East Asian lineage. However, the selection on one of the subhaplotypes in JPT seems to have been relaxed or ceased after divergence from the continental population; this may have caused the elevation of T allele frequency.

rs1800629,39049478,Association of polymorphisms of HSD11B1 and ACE genes with trachoma disease.,"Trachoma, caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, is the most common infectious blindness in the world and is present in indigenous Mayan from Chiapas (Mexico). Inflammatory genes are activated when suffering from trachoma, thus some polymorphisms could increase the susceptibility to develop irreversible blindness. This study aimed to evaluate the genetic risk of developing late-stage trachoma in Mayan ethnic groups. In a case-control study (n = 51 vs n = 102, respectively), the following single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to inflammation were analysed: HSD11B1 (rs11807619), HSD11B1 (rs932335), ABCG2 (rs2231142), SLCO1B1 (rs4149056), IL-10 (rs1800890), TNF (rs1800629), MMP2 (rs243865) and ACE. Three SNPs were associated with late-stage trachoma risk: (i) the T allele of rs11807619, (ii) the C allele of rs932335, which are linked to the HSD11B1 gene (OR = 22.5-27.3), particularly in men when adjusts for gender (OR = 16-16.7); and (iii) D allele of rs4340 in the ACE gene (OR = 5.2-5.3). In fact, significant linkage disequilibrium demonstrated association between ACE gene and HSD11B1 SNPs (r = 0.17-0.179; P = 0.0048-0.0073).

rs1800629,38999258,TNF-alfa Gene Polymorphism Associations with Multiple Sclerosis.,"Background:TNF-α has a dual role in multiple sclerosis (MS), contributing to both protective and harmful effects. It activates immune cells, promotes the formation of inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system, and stimulates the production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to myelin destruction and neuronal damage. Our research focused on investigating the relationship between TNF-alpha (rs1800630, rs1800629, and rs361525) gene polymorphisms and MS. Methods: 250 healthy controls and 250 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients were included in the study. DNA was extracted from leucocytes from peripheral venous blood by salt precipitation. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested using RT-PCR. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 29.0 data analysis software. Results: The analysis revealed that the rs361525 AG genotype was significantly less frequent in the MS group compared to the control group (4.0% vs. 7.2%, p = 0.042). Sex-specific analysis showed a significant difference in genotype distribution (GG, AG, AA) among males between the MS group and the control group (97.7%, 0%, 2.3% vs. 90.6%, 9.4%, 0%, p = 0.005). For the rs1800629 polymorphism, significant results were also found. In subjects younger than 39 years, the A allele was significantly less frequent in the MS group than in the control group (8.6% vs. 15.0%, p = 0.030). The most robust model indicated that the AA genotype reduced the odds of MS by approximately 2 fold compared to the AG + GG genotype (p = 0.044), and each A allele reduced the odds of MS by approximately 2 fold (p = 0.028). The rs1800630 A allele was significantly more common in males in the MS group than in the control group (21.0% vs. 12.9%, p = 0.046). Conclusions: In conclusion, our study identifies significant associations between TNF-alpha gene variants and MS. Specifically, the rs631525 AG genotype was less common in the MS group, with notable sex-specific differences observed. The rs1800629 A allele was statistically significantly less frequent in the MS group than in the control group, and the AA genotype reduced the odds of MS occurrence by ~2 fold compared with the AG + GG genotypes. Additionally, each A allele of rs1800629 was linked to a 2-fold decreased odds of MS occurrence. In males, the rs1800630 A allele was more frequent in the MS group. These findings highlight the relevance of TNF-alpha genetic variations in MS susceptibility, suggesting potential avenues for further research and therapeutic exploration.",,,Low

However, a pause in research is evident concerning the TNF-α gene with kidney disease in the inhabitants of India. So, this study investigates the association between TNF-α rs1800629 polymorphism and CKD. Methodology A prospective case-control study was conducted in Andhra Pradesh for over three years. A total of 579 patients participated in the study. These were divided into premature, late-stage CKD, and control groups.

Methods: A total of 199 blood samples from pregnant women who had given birth prematurely and 200 control blood samples were analyzed to determine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes for IL-6 (rs1800796), IL-10 (rs1800896) and TNFα (rs1800629). The control samples were samples from pregnant women with term delivery. The isolation of DNA was performed on mini-spin columns according to the manufacturer's protocol. The quality and purity of the isolated DNA were tested using a Qubit 3 fluorometer. Genotyping was performed with an ABI PRISM 7500 SDS using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays.

The presence of the G/G genotype in the recessive inheritance model compared with the G/A and A/A genotypes for the rs1800896 SNP of the IL-10 gene represents a potentially protective factor, with mothers in the term-birth group having an almost 2-fold lower odds of PTB in general and an almost 10-fold lower odds of early PTB. On the other hand, carriers of the A/G genotype of rs1800896 have a 1.54-fold higher chance of preterm birth in general and a 1.6-fold higher chance of late preterm birth in the superdominant inheritance model compared to the A/A and G/G genotypes in the group of mothers with PTB. In this study, no association was found between PTB and the rs1800796 SNP of the IL-6 gene. Conclusions: rs1800629 in mothers was associated with PTB. rs1800896 shows a potentially protective effect for the occurrence of PTB in this study. No association was found between PTB and rs1800796.",High

The participants, 261 15-year-old children, were divided into two groups: 82 cases (i.e., children with DMFT (Decayed, Missing, and Filled Teeth) index >5, having either moderate or high caries experience, assigned as the ""higher"" caries experience group) and 179 controls (i.e., children with DMFT ≤ 5, having either low or very low caries experience, assigned as the ""lower"" caries experience group). Genomic DNA was isolated from buccal swabs, and genotyping was determined by means of real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction). There were no significant differences in the genotype or allele distributions in all tested SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) between children with ""higher"" caries experience and those with ""lower"" caries experience. TLR4 haplotype frequencies did not differ significantly between cases and controls. In an additional analysis with another case definition applied (subjects with DMFT ≥ 1 were assigned as ""cases"", whereas children with DMFT = 0 were assigned as ""controls""), no significant differences in the TLR2 and TLR4 genotype, allele frequencies, and TLR4 haplotype frequencies were found between the case and the control groups.

We aimed to assess the association of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL-6 (rs1800795 G > C, rs1800797 A > G) and interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) (rs2228145 A > C) genes with HIV-1 infection, AIDS progression, and response to treatment. In this case-control study involving 199 individuals living with HIV-1 and 200 HIV-uninfected controls, we conducted genotyping of IL-6/IL-6R SNPs using TaqMan real-time PCR assays. Soluble IL-6 levels were measured using ELISA. No associations were found between the investigated SNPs and HIV infection. However, a significant association was noted between the C-G and G-A haplotypes and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. Additionally, a significant association was revealed between HIV-1 RNA viral loads and IL-6 SNP G > C in the post-treatment HIV group. Interestingly, we observed a significant association between the investigated SNPs and protection against progression to AIDS, namely the IL-6 G > A SNP in its recessive model and the IL-6R A > C SNP in its codominant and dominant models. Nevertheless, we found no significant differences between IL-6 levels and the different genotypes and alleles of the IL-6 gene either before or after combination antiretroviral therapy. IL-6 promoter haplotypes are associated with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, IL-6 A > G and IL-6R A > C polymorphisms have been associated with protection against AIDS progression. Interestingly, the IL-6 G > C SNP may affect the response to treatment in people living with HIV-1.",,,Low
rs1800795,38791322,No Association of Polymorphisms in the Genes Encoding Interleukin-6 and Interleukin-6 Receptor Subunit Alpha with the Risk of Keloids in Polish Patients.,"A keloid is a benign fibroproliferative hypertrophy of scar tissue that extends outside the original wound and invades adjacent healthy skin. Keloid formation is thought to be a complex process including overactivity of the interleukin-6 signaling pathway and genetic susceptibility. The aim of the study was to investigate possible associations between rs1800797, rs1800796, and rs1800795 polymorphisms in the promoter of the IL6 gene encoding interleukin-6 and the rs2228145 polymorphism in the IL6R gene encoding the interleukin-6 receptor subunit alpha with the predisposition to keloids in Polish patients. The genetic polymorphisms were identified either using Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) or sequencing of samples of genomic DNA extracted from blood leukocytes of 86 adult patients with keloids and 100 newborns comprising a control group. No significant differences in the distributions of IL6 or IL6R alleles or genotypes were found between keloid patients and newborn controls. There were also no significant differences between both groups in the distribution of IL6 haplotypes. The IL6 rs1800797, rs1800796 and rs1800795 and IL6R rs2228145 polymorphisms were not found to predispose individuals in the study group to keloids.

rs1800795,38756907,Association of IL‑6 and MMP‑3 gene polymorphisms with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: A systematic review and meta‑analysis.,"The pathogenesis of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) remains unclear. It has been found that interleukin-6 (IL-6) rs1800795 locus and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) rs3025058 locus gene polymorphisms may be associated with AIS susceptibility, which has been controversial and needs to be further confirmed by updated meta-analysis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of MMP-3 rs3025058 and IL-6 rs1800795 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with susceptibility to AIS. All relevant articles that met the criteria were retrieved and included, and the publication dates were limited from January 2005 to December 2023. The allele frequencies and different genotype frequencies of IL-6 rs1800795 and MMP-3 rs3025058 loci in each study were extracted and statistically analyzed by ReviewManager 5.4 software, and the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of different genetic models were calculated. The results of the meta-analysis showed that there was no significant association between the gene polymorphism of IL-6 rs1800795 locus and the pathogenesis of AIS. The allele 5A and genotype 5A5A of MMP-3 rs3025058 SNP were associated with AIS susceptibility (5A vs. 6A, OR=1.18; 95% CI, 1.04-1.33; 5A5A vs. 6A6A, OR=1.65; 95% CI, 1.23-2.21; and 5A5A vs. 5A6A + 6A6A, OR=1.54; 95% CI, 1.19-1.99).

This review and meta-analysis investigated the contribution of the polymorphisms of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines and their receptors to the risk of ACLR. The scientific databases Science Direct, EBSCO host, Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar were screened (completed on 14 June 2023) according to the established inclusion/exclusion criteria (only fully accessible, original, human case-control studies written in English concerning the effect of interleukin genes' polymorphisms on the occurrence of ACL injury were included) and statistical meta-analysis using R version 4.0.3 was performed. The PRISMA methodology was used to review articles. The review protocol was registered under the number CRD42024514316 in the Prospero database. Eighty-nine studies were identified and narrowed down to three original case-control studies used for the meta-analysis. The studies analyzed Polish, South African, and Swedish cohorts, altogether 1282 participants. The candidate polymorphisms indicated in the studies involved IL6 rs1800795, IL6R rs2228145 and IL1B rs16944. The systematic review showed the relationships between IL6 rs1800795 polymorphism and ACLR in the Polish subpopulation, and IL6R rs2228145 and IL1B rs16944 in the South African subpopulations. The meta-analysis revealed that the IL6 rs1800795 CG genotype was over-represented (OR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.02-1.66), while the CC genotype was under-represented (OR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.54-1.03) in ACLR subjects, but no significant impact of IL6R rs2228145 was shown. Additionally, a tendency of the IL1B rs16944 CT genotype to be protective (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.70-1.14), while the TT to be a risk genotype (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.84-1.68) was observed. Thus, the relationship between the interleukin receptor IL6R rs2228145 and ACLR risk was not confirmed. However, the impact of genes coding pleiotropic IL6 rs1800795 on the incidences of ACLR was clear and the effect of pro-inflammatory IL1B rs16944 was possible.",,,Low

Clinical outcomes for affected individuals range from being asymptomatic to severe illnesses requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Among the various factors contributing to the variation in clinical outcomes, host genetics play a prominent role. Interleukin-6 (IL6), a key player in immune responses, has been identified as having a crucial impact on viral infections, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Specifically, certain variations known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL6 promoter region have been found to significantly influence IL6 expression and the severity of viral infections. Materials and Methods: To explore the relationship between these genetic variations and COVID-19 in asymptomatic and ICU-admitted Kurdish patients, genetic sequencing was performed to determine the genotypes of nine IL6 SNPs. Results: The study findings revealed that although the proportion of the GG genotype of rs1800795 was slightly higher in asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, the difference was not statistically significant (chi2 = 2.666, p = 0.236). Notably, Kurdish patients displayed a uniform genetic makeup (monomorphic) for the dominant alleles of rs2069830 (C), rs142759801 (C), rs2069857 (C), rs2069829 (G), rs2234683 (G), rs13447446 (T), rs527770772 (C), and rs13447445 (C).

rs1800795,38541094,Determination of IL-6 Gene Promoter Polymorphism in Patients with Hepatitis C and Its Impact on RNA Secondary Structure.,"Background and Objectives: A polymorphism in the promoter region of the IL-6 gene would influence the level of IL-6 expression in patients with HCV, resulting in a pro-inflammatory response. Few studies have shown the association between -174G>C (rs1800795) and -1363G>T (rs2069827) polymorphisms and HCV infection, and their results have been contradictory. There are no data published in our population to study such an IL-6 stimulus against HCV infection and its impact on RNA secondary structure. Therefore, we isolated human subjects from the province of Punjab, Pakistan. The objective was to screen for IL-6 gene promoter polymorphisms -174G/C and -1363G/T and those correlated with serum concentrations of IL-6 in patients with HCV and compared with a control. Materials and Methods: In conventional PCR, measurement of serum IL-6 by CLIA and statistical analysis were performed to observe the genotype association studies. By integrating bioinformatics and computational tools, our study aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how variations in the promoter region of IL-6 may have functional implications on gene expression. Results: The -174G>C and -1363G>T genotypes in the promoter region of patients with HCV were in strong allelic association (Δ = 0.97, p < 0.001).

We studied the genotype distribution in a group of 168 Caucasian females in whom body mass and composition parameters, the lipid profile, and glucose levels were measured before and after the exercise period. Our results showed that carriers of the IL1A rs1800597 CC genotype exhibited a significant decrease in total body water (TBW) in response to training (p = 0.045). Additionally, carriers of the IL6 rs1800797 GG and GA genotypes demonstrated a posttraining decrease in body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.039). Haplotype analysis revealed that only rare haplotypes, namely, GGA, CGG and CCG (rs1800795, rs1800796, and rs1800797, respectively), were linked to changes in phenotype, yet assessing individual haplotype effects was not possible. Studies of the interactions between these genes showed that carrying the TC-GG genotype (rs1800587-rs1800795 and rs1800587-rs1800796) may be associated with greater posttraining decreases in fat mass percentage (%FM) and fat-free mass (FM). Carriers of the CC-CG genotype (rs1800587-rs1800795) had significantly greater changes in triglycerides (TGL) over the training period.

Furthermore, our results sustained that the post-transcriptional regulation of hTERT contributes to CTCL lymphomagenesis. Indeed, CTCL cells present a different pattern of hTERT spliced transcripts distribution from the controls, mostly marked by an increase in the hTERT β+ variants proportion. This increase seems to be associated with CTCL development and progression. Through hTERT splicing transcriptome modulation with shRNAs, we observed that the decrease in the α-β+ transcript induced a decrease in the cell proliferation and tumorigenic capacities of T-MF cells in vitro.

In this study, we explored the association between TERT rs2853676 genetic polymorphisms and the prognosis of Chinese glioma patients. A total of 481 glioma patients at the Tangdu Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University in China were included in this study.

At diagnosis, the rs2736100CC genotype was associated with longer telomeres measured pre-CRT, while the rs2736100CC, rs2736108TT and rs2735940AA were associated with greater telomere erosion evaluated post-CRT. The rs2736108CC and rs2853690AA/GG genotypes, respectively associated with lower telomere erosion and lower levels of circulating TERT post-CRT, were also independently associated with a better response to therapy [OR 4.6(1.1-19.1) and 3.0(1.3-6.9)]. Overall, post-CRT, low levels (≤ median value) of circulating TERT and its stable/decreasing levels compared to those pre-CRT, were independently associated with a better response to therapy [OR 5.8(1.9-17.8) and 5.3(1.4-19.4), respectively].

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TERT gene can affect telomere length and TERT expression and have been associated with risk and/or outcome for several tumors, but very few data are available about their impact on rectal cancer. Eight SNPs (rs2736108, rs2735940, rs2736098, rs2736100, rs35241335, rs11742908, rs2736122 and rs2853690), mapping in regulatory and coding regions of the TERT gene, were studied in 194 rectal cancer patients to evaluate their association with constitutive telomere length, circulating TERT mRNA levels, response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and disease outcome. At diagnosis, the rs2736100CC genotype was associated with longer telomeres measured pre-CRT, while the rs2736100CC, rs2736108TT and rs2735940AA were associated with greater telomere erosion evaluated post-CRT.

rs401681,29939218,rs401681 and rs402710 confer lung cancer susceptibility by regulating TERT expression instead of CLPTM1L in East Asian populations.,"Lung cancer is a common cancer in human and has presented significant genetic predisposition. Previous genome-wide association study observed that rs401681 within CLPTM1L (CLPTM1 like) was significantly associated with lung cancer. By analyzing 1000 genomes data for East Asian, we identified only one SNP in nearby region, rs402710, in high linkage disequilibrium with rs401681, which was also associated with lung cancer. However, the real causal SNP and mechanism for the association were still not clear. The following plasmid construction, mutagenesis, transient transfection and luciferase reading indicated that both SNPs could regulate gene expression in lung/bronchial epithelium Beas-2B cell line. By chromosome conformation capture, it was identified that the segment containing these two SNPs could interact with TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) promoter, thus indicating that these SNPs confer lung cancer risk by regulating TERT expression instead of CLPTM1L. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation, the transcript factors HNF4A (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha) and MAF1 (MAF1 homolog, negative regulator of RNA polymerase III) were recognized for the regions spanning rs401681 and rs402710, respectively.

In the replication study, eight SNPs (rs401681, rs3019885, rs732765, rs2568494, rs16969968, rs6495309, rs11634351, and rs4105144) associated with lung adenocarcinoma risk and three (rs9557635, rs4105144, and rs735482) associated with survival. Five of these SNPs acted as cis-eQTLs, being associated with the transcription of IREB2 (rs2568494, rs16969968, rs11634351, rs6495309), PSMA4 (rs6495309) and ERCC1 (rs735482), out of 10,821 genes analyzed in lung. For these three genes, we obtained experimental evidence of differential allelic expression in lung tissue, pointing to the existence of in-cis genomic variants that regulate their transcription. These results suggest that these SNPs exert their effects on cancer risk/outcome through the modulation of mRNA levels of their target genes.",cancer,"Genetic susceptibility variants for lung cancer: replication study and assessment as expression quantitative trait loci.

We used polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) to determine the mir146a rs2910164 and mir196a-2 rs11614913 genotypes in 362 CRC patients and 362 controls. We also assessed the interactions between these genotypes and age, gender, smoking, alcohol consumption, and BMI status on CRC risk. Additionally, the serum expression level of mir196a-2 was quantified using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Our findings demonstrated that among the controls, the proportions of TT, CT, and CC genotypes of mir196a-2 rs11614913 were 32.3%, 48.1%, and 19.6%, respectively. As for the cases, the proportions were 24.6%, 45.0%, and 30.4%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the CC genotype carriers had a 2.04-fold increased risk (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.36-3.06, p = 0.0008). Furthermore, carriers of the CT + CC genotypes also exhibited a significant association with CRC risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.06-2.03, p = 0.0261). Moreover, carriers of the CC genotype had significantly higher serum levels of mir196a-2 compared to those with the TT genotype (p < 0.0001), indicating a genotype-phenotype correlation.

However, the precise processes are still not entirely understood. Contradictory studies suggest that miR-146a expression could be influenced by the miR-146a rs2910164 C > G polymorphism. This case-control study aimed to investigate the association of miR-146a rs2910164 C > G gene polymorphism and its impact on circulating miR-146a expression levels in Egyptian IBD patients. We included 40 IBD patients and 30 matched healthy controls. Genotyping of miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism and assessment of miR-146a expression level were done using quantitative real-time PCR in all participants. MiR-146a rs2910164 GG genotype and the G allele were reported in 47% and 70% of the IBD patient group, respectively. And they were associated with increased IBD risk. All the IBD patients with the CC genotype (100%) and most of those with the CG genotype (66.67%) had an inactive disease, while most IBD patients with the GG genotype (73.68%) had an active disease.

MicroRNA-146a (miR-146a) has been involved in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the precise processes are still not entirely understood. Contradictory studies suggest that miR-146a expression could be influenced by the miR-146a rs2910164 C > G polymorphism. This case-control study aimed to investigate the association of miR-146a rs2910164 C > G gene polymorphism and its impact on circulating miR-146a expression levels in Egyptian IBD patients. We included 40 IBD patients and 30 matched healthy controls. Genotyping of miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism and assessment of miR-146a expression level were done using quantitative real-time PCR in all participants. MiR-146a rs2910164 GG genotype and the G allele were reported in 47% and 70% of the IBD patient group, respectively. And they were associated with increased IBD risk. All the IBD patients with the CC genotype (100%) and most of those with the CG genotype (66.67%) had an inactive disease, while most IBD patients with the GG genotype (73.68%) had an active disease. The miR-146a expression level was the highest with the CC genotype and the lowest with the GG genotype.

Moreover, no studies have shown an association between these SNVs and susceptibility to drug-resistant and drug-responsive TLE in Brazil. Thus, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples from 120 patients with TLE (55 drug-responsive and 65 drug-resistant) were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A total of 1171 healthy blood donor individuals from the Online Archive of Brazilian Mutations (ABraOM, from Portuguese Arquivo Brasileiro On-line de Mutações), a repository containing genomic variants of the Brazilian population, were added as a control population for the studied SNVs. MIR-146A and SCN1A relative expression was performed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The statistical analysis protocol was performed using an alpha error of 0.05. TLE patient samples and ABraOM control samples were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for all studied SNVs. For rs2910164, the frequencies of the homozygous genotype (CC) (15.00% vs. 9.65%) and C allele (37.80% vs. 29.97%) were superior in patients with TLE compared to controls with a higher risk for TLE disease [odds ratio (OR) = 1.89 (95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 1.06-3.37); OR = 1.38 (95%CI = 1.04-1.82), respectively].

The present study aimed to assess whether the pretransplant characteristics of IL-17A and IL-17F, their receptors, as well as miR-146a-5p, an miRNA associated with IL-17A/F regulation, can predict KTx outcomes. Methods: A group of 108 pre-KTx dialysis patients and 125 healthy controls were investigated for single nucleotide substitutions within genes coding for IL-17A, IL-17F, their IL-17RA/RC receptors, and miR-146a-5p. Genotyping was performed using LightSNiP assays. In addition, IL17-A/F serum concentrations were determined using ELISA while miR-146a-5p expression was analyzed by RT-PCR. Results: The IL-17F (rs763780) G allele prevailed in KTx recipients as compared to healthy individuals (OR = 23.59, p < 0.0001) and was associated with a higher IL-17F serum level (p = 0.0381) prior to transplantation. Higher miR-146a-5p expression before KTx was more frequently detected in recipients with an increased IL-17A serum concentration (p = 0.0177). Moreover, IL-17A (rs2275913) GG homozygosity was found to be associated with an increased incidence of deaths before KTx (OR = 4.17, p = 0.0307).

Previous studies have identified ∼35 miRNAs, including miR-146a-5p, which are up-regulated in the frontal cortex of males with alcohol use disorder (AUD), but the influence of liver cirrhosis and sex is unknown. The expression of miR-146a-5p, IRAK1, and TRAF6 was measured in the prefrontal cortex of controls and individuals with AUD with and without cirrhosis of the liver. Further, individuals were genotyped for two SNPs, rs2910164 and rs57095329. The expression of miR-146a-5p was significantly different between sexes. In males the expression of miR-146a-5p was increased in individuals with AUD with and without liver cirrhosis compared with controls.

Materials and Methods: For genotyping, classical methods of PCR-RFLP analysis were used. A sample of 446 DNA samples from Yakut volunteers without chronic diseases (143 women and 303 men) was studied. Results: The predominance of the ancestral alleles of SNPs rs174537, rs174546 and rs3834458 was established in all of our studied groups. Analysis of the odds ratio of allele and genotype frequencies in patients with normal BMI, high BMI and obesity did not show statistically significant values. We did not find an association between rs174537, rs174546 and rs3834458 with obesity, but we did not take into account the diet of the subjects, which may have had a stronger effect on BMI. Analysis of pairwise linkage disequilibrium and assessment of haplotypes for 3 SNPs in the FADS1 and FADS2 genes showed strong linkage of all three SNPs to each other (r2 = 0.93-0.96). Conclusions: According to the result of genotyping of SNP rs174537, the frequency of haplotype A in the Yakut population was 0.76 and, in comparison with other world data, is quite high. Which in turn is associated with lower conversion of short-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid to long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid. Accordingly, a shift in nutrition towards more plant foods can negatively impact the health of the Yakuts.

A sample of 446 DNA samples from Yakut volunteers without chronic diseases (143 women and 303 men) was studied. Results: The predominance of the ancestral alleles of SNPs rs174537, rs174546 and rs3834458 was established in all of our studied groups. Analysis of the odds ratio of allele and genotype frequencies in patients with normal BMI, high BMI and obesity did not show statistically significant values. We did not find an association between rs174537, rs174546 and rs3834458 with obesity, but we did not take into account the diet of the subjects, which may have had a stronger effect on BMI. Analysis of pairwise linkage disequilibrium and assessment of haplotypes for 3 SNPs in the FADS1 and FADS2 genes showed strong linkage of all three SNPs to each other (r2 = 0.93-0.96). Conclusions: According to the result of genotyping of SNP rs174537, the frequency of haplotype A in the Yakut population was 0.76 and, in comparison with other world data, is quite high. Which in turn is associated with lower conversion of short-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid to long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid. Accordingly, a shift in nutrition towards more plant foods can negatively impact the health of the Yakuts. At the moment, the exact dosage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) for humans has not yet been established, but judging by the fact that all recommendations are mainly made on the basis of European populations, in connection with the results of the study, the Yakuts have a particularly high need for PUFAs.",High

rs174537,36449220,Age-associated changes in circulatory fatty acids: new insights on adults and long-lived individuals.,"Long-lived individuals (LLIs) are considered an ideal model to study healthy human aging. Blood fatty acid (FA) profile of a cohort of LLIs (90-111 years old, n = 49) from Sicily was compared to adults (18-64 years old, n = 69) and older adults (65-89 years old, n = 54) from the same area. Genetic variants in key enzymes related to FA biosynthesis and metabolism were also genotyped to investigate a potential genetic predisposition in determining the FA profile. Gas chromatography was employed to determine the FA profile, and genotyping was performed using high-resolution melt (HRM) analysis. Blood levels of total polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) and total trans-FA decreased with age, while the levels of saturated FA (SFA) remained unchanged. Interestingly, distinctively higher circulatory levels of monounsaturated FA (MUFA) in LLIs compared to adults and older adults were observed. In addition, among LLIs, rs174537 in the FA desaturase 1/2 (FADS1/2) gene was associated with linoleic acid (LA, 18:2n-6) and docosatetraenoic acid (DTA, 22:4n-6) levels, and the rs953413 in the elongase of very long FA 2 (ELOVL2) was associated with DTA levels. We further observed that rs174579 and rs174626 genotypes in FADS1/2 significantly affect delta-6 desaturase (D6D) activity. In conclusion, our results suggest that the LLIs have a different FA profile characterized by high MUFA content, which indicates reduced peroxidation while maintaining membrane fluidity.",,,Low

Genetic variation in the FADS gene cluster accounts for a large portion of interindividual differences in circulating and tissue levels of LC-PUFAs, with the genotypes most strongly predictive of low LC-PUFA levels at strikingly higher frequencies in Amerind ancestry populations. In this study, we examined relationships between genetic ancestry and FADS variation in 1102 Hispanic American participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. We demonstrate strong negative associations between Amerind genetic ancestry and LC-PUFA levels. The FADS rs174537 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) accounted for much of the AI ancestry effect on LC-PUFAs, especially for low levels of n-3 LC-PUFAs. Rs174537 was also strongly associated with several metabolic, inflammatory and anthropomorphic traits including circulating triglycerides (TGs) and E-selectin in MESA Hispanics.

This study examines the relationship between two SNPs in the FADS1 gene (rs174546, rs174537) and the fatty acid (FA) composition of serum lipids in adolescents (13-18 years). We used DNA samples (670 children; 336 girls and 334 boys) from the Childhood Obesity Prevalence and Treatment (COPAT) project. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes in whole blood samples. For genotype analysis, TaqMan SNP Genotyping assays (Applied Biosystems) were used.

Therefore, we sought to (1) characterize the circulating PUFA response and (2) evaluate the impact of rs174537 on inflammation after TBI. A prospective, single-center, observational pilot study was conducted to collect blood samples from Level-1 trauma patients (N = 130) on admission and 24 h post-admission. Plasma was used to quantify PUFA levels and inflammatory cytokines. Deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted and genotyped at rs174537. Associations between PUFAs and inflammatory cytokines were analyzed for all trauma cases and stratified by race (Caucasians only), TBI (TBI: N = 47; non-TBI = 83) and rs174537 genotype (GG: N = 33, GT/TT: N = 44). Patients with TBI had higher plasma DHA levels compared with non-TBI at 24 h post-injury (p = 0.013). The SNP rs174537 was associated with both PUFA levels and inflammatory cytokines (p < 0.05). Specifically, TBI patients with GG genotype exhibited the highest plasma levels of DHA (1.33%) and interleukin-8 (121.5 ± 43.3 pg/mL), which were in turn associated with poorer outcomes. These data illustrate the impact of rs174537 on the post-TBI response. Further work is needed to ascertain how this genetic variant directly influences inflammation after trauma.",,,Low

This heterogeneity may be explained by genetic variation within the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) gene cluster that is associated with circulating and tissue concentrations of arachidonic acid (ARA) and dihomo-ɣ-linolenic acid (DGLA), both of which may be synthesized from GLA and result in proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory metabolites, respectively.",,,Low

It has been shown that erythrocyte phospholipid membrane concentrations of ARA are strongly determined by genetic variation. Fatty acid desaturase (FADS) controls the rate limiting step in ARA production, and FADS variant rs174537 has been shown to be responsible for up to 18.6% of the variation seen. To determine if a causal association exists between erythrocyte membrane ARA concentrations and colorectal adenomas, we conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using rs174537 as an instrumental variable (IV).

rs4242382,26966665,An examination of clinical differences between carriers and non-carriers of chromosome 8q24 risk alleles in a New Zealand Caucasian population with prostate cancer.,"Background. Prostate cancer makes up approximately 15% of all cancers diagnosed in men in developed nations and approximately 4% of cases in developing nations. Although it is clear that prostate cancer has a genetic component and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can contribute to prostate cancer risk, detecting associations is difficult in multi-factorial diseases, as environmental and lifestyle factors also play a role. In this study, specific clinical characteristics, environmental factors and genetic risk factors were assessed for interaction with prostate cancer. Methods. A total of 489 prostate cancer cases and 427 healthy controls were genotyped for SNPs found on chromosome 8q24 and a genetic risk score was calculated. In addition the SNPs were tested for an association with a number of clinical and environmental factors. Results. Age and tobacco use were positively associated, whilst alcohol consumption was negatively associated with prostate cancer risk. The following SNPs found on chromosome 8q24 were statistically significantly associated with prostate cancer: rs10086908, rs16901979; rs1447295and rs4242382. No association between Gleason score and smoking status, or between Gleason score and genotype were detected. Conclusion. A genetic risk score was calculated based on the 15 SNPs tested and found to be significantly associated with prostate cancer risk.

Prostate cancer makes up approximately 15% of all cancers diagnosed in men in developed nations and approximately 4% of cases in developing nations. Although it is clear that prostate cancer has a genetic component and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can contribute to prostate cancer risk, detecting associations is difficult in multi-factorial diseases, as environmental and lifestyle factors also play a role. In this study, specific clinical characteristics, environmental factors and genetic risk factors were assessed for interaction with prostate cancer. Methods. A total of 489 prostate cancer cases and 427 healthy controls were genotyped for SNPs found on chromosome 8q24 and a genetic risk score was calculated. In addition the SNPs were tested for an association with a number of clinical and environmental factors. Results. Age and tobacco use were positively associated, whilst alcohol consumption was negatively associated with prostate cancer risk. The following SNPs found on chromosome 8q24 were statistically significantly associated with prostate cancer: rs10086908, rs16901979; rs1447295and rs4242382.

rs6983561,26828504,The Cumulative Effect of Gene-Gene and Gene-Environment Interactions on the Risk of Prostate Cancer in Chinese Men.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a multifactorial disease involving complex genetic and environmental factors interactions. Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions associated with PCa in Chinese men are less studied. We explored the association between 36 SNPs and PCa in 574 subjects from northern China. Body mass index (BMI), smoking, and alcohol consumption were determined through self-administered questionnaires in 134 PCa patients. Then gene-gene and gene-environment interactions among the PCa-associated SNPs were analyzed using the generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) and logistic regression methods.

In addition, two SNPs that extend the boundaries of the 8q24 region were significantly associated with risk: rs979200 at the centromeric boundary and rs3891248, located in the first intron of the c-MYC gene (IVS1-355), which identifies a new telomeric boundary. Recently, the 8q24 region has been identified as a prostate cancer susceptibility locus in a genome-wide scan of prostate cancer families in Iceland and an admixture scan of African Americans. Further investigations of variants at 8q24 have shown the existence of additional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that enhance prostate cancer risk, suggesting the possibility of multiple regions harboring variants for the disease. In the present population-based study of Caucasians (1,308 cases and 1,266 controls) and African Americans (149 cases and 85 controls), we tested the association between prostate cancer and 23 SNPs in the 8q24 region. Fourteen SNPs in Caucasians and 5 SNPs in African Americans were significantly associated with risk of prostate cancer after adjusting for multiple comparisons; of these, 5 SNPs in Caucasians and 3 in African Americans were independently associated with risk. The strongest association was for rs6983561 (carriers of any C allele) with an odds ratio of 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.1) in Caucasians; variants in rs979200, rs1016343, rs7837328, and rs10090154 were also independently associated with risk.

rs6983561,18360876,Chromosome 8q24 markers: risk of early-onset and familial prostate cancer.,"Recent admixture mapping and linkage/association studies have implicated an approximately 1 Mb region on chromosome 8q24 in prostate cancer susceptibility. In a subsequent follow-up investigation, Haiman et al. (Nat Genet 2007;39:638-44) observed significant, independent associations between 7 markers within this region and sporadic prostate cancer risk in a multi-ethnic sample. To clarify the risk associated with hereditary prostate cancer, we tested for prostate cancer association with 6 of these 7 markers in a sample of 1,015 non-Hispanic white men with and without prostate cancer from 403 familial and early-onset prostate cancer families. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs6983561 and rs6983267 showed the strongest evidence of prostate cancer association. Using a family-based association test, the minor (""C"") allele of rs6983561 and the major (""G"") allele of rs6983267 were preferentially transmitted to affected men (p < 0.05), with estimated odds ratios (ORs) of 2.26 (95% confidence interval of 1.06-4.83) and 1.30 (95% confidence interval of 0.99-1.71), respectively, for an additive model. Notably, rs6983561 was significantly associated with prostate cancer among men diagnosed at an early (<50 years) but not later age (p = 0.03 versus p = 0.21). Similarly, the association with rs6983267 was (not) statistically significant among men with(out) clinically aggressive disease (p = 0.007 versus p = 0.34). Our results confirm the association of prostate cancer with several of the SNPs on chromosome 8q24 initially reported by Haiman et al. In addition, our results suggest that the increased risk associated with these SNPs is approximately doubled in individuals predisposed to develop early onset or clinically aggressive disease.","cancer, disease","Chromosome 8q24 markers: risk of early-onset and familial prostate cancer.

Recently, multiple evidence suggests that DNA methylation play an important role in regulating blood pressure. Here, we tested the risk for essential hypertension conferred by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). Three loci (rs2228611, rs2228612, and rs16999593) were selected to be analyzed in 3410 cases and 1307 normal controls in southern Chinese aged 60 or above. No significant association with essential hypertension was observed for rs2228612 and rs16999593. A higher risk of essential hypertension was found in the minor A allele of rs2228611 in the codominant and recessive model (P < 0.05). After stratified by sex, this association was found in male but not female. Furthermore, this difference was abolished after BMI adjustment in the whole population and reduced in male. In addition, the mutation rate of rs2228611 was higher in the obesity group compared with the normal weight group of male. Intriguingly, rs2228611 was also a risk factor of essential hypertension in normal weight male. These findings indicated that rs2228611 might contribute to male hypertension via BMI-dependent mechanisms in obesity male and BMI-independent mechanisms in normal weight male.",,,Low

However, the exact etiology of TGA is unknown. The aim of the present study was to assess the association of TGA pathogenesis with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)-1 and 3a- in Chinese children. We genotyped 5 SNPs (rs16999593, rs16999358, and rs2228611 in DNMT1; and rs2276599 and rs2276598 in DNMT3A) in 206 patients with complete TGA and 252 healthy children. Statistical analysis was performed to explore the association of the 5 SNPs with complete TGA susceptibility. Compared with the T/T and C/C genotypes, the heterozygous genotype C/T of rs16999593 correlated with a decreased risk for complete TGA under codominant (OR=0.46; 95% CI=0.29-0.72), dominant (OR=0.58; 95% CI=0.38-0.88), and overdominant (OR=0.44; 95% CI=0.28-0.68) models. In contrast, the genotype C/C of rs16999593 correlated with a higher risk for TGA under a recessive model (OR=3.15; 95% CI=1.14-8.68) compared with the T/T and C/T genotypes. Furthermore, the TGC, TGT, CGC, and CGT haplotypes of DNMT1 did not differ significantly between the two groups, whereas the frequency of the TAC haplotype was lower in the case group (OR<1; P=0.002). No significant differences in the frequencies of the TC, CC, TT, and CT haplotypes of DNMT3A were found between the two groups. Furthermore, logistic regression showed that sex and the rs16999358 SNP were two independent risk factors for complete TGA.

To explore the relationship between DNMT1 and spermatogenesis impairment, polymorphic distributions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) rs16999593, rs2228612 and rs2228611 in DNMT1 were investigated in 342 infertile patients with idiopathic azoospermia or oligospermia and 232 fertile controls in a Chinese population. As a result, no significant differences in allele and genotype frequencies of the three SNP between total patients and controls were observed. However, after stratifying the patients, significant differences in allele and genotype frequencies were detected between oligospermia subgroup and control group.

In gene-based analyses, we confirmed BRCA2 (P = 0.007) and ATM (P = 0.014) associations with LC risk and identified TRIB3 (P = 0.009), involved in maintaining genome stability and DNA repair, as a new candidate susceptibility gene. Furthermore, cases were enriched with RDVs in homologous recombination repair [carrier frequency (CF) = 22.9% versus 19.5%, P = 0.017] and Fanconi anemia (CF = 12.5% versus 10.2%, P = 0.036) pathways. Our results were not significant after multiple testing corrections but were enriched in cases versus controls from large scale public biobank resources, including The Cancer Genome Atlas, FinnGen and UK Biobank. Our study identifies novel candidate genes and highlights the importance of RDVs in DNA repair-related genes for LC susceptibility. These findings improve our understanding of LC heritability and may contribute to the development of risk stratification and prevention strategies.",High

The effect of both mutations in important DNA repair genes on sporadic PDAC risk may shed light on the genetic architecture of this disease. Both mutations were genotyped in germline DNA from 2,935 sporadic PDAC cases and 5,626 control subjects within the PANcreatic Disease ReseArch (PANDoRA) consortium.

rs8170,23805179,A Genome-Wide Association Study Suggests Novel Loci Associated with a Schizophrenia-Related Brain-Based Phenotype.,"Patients with schizophrenia and their siblings typically show subtle changes of brain structures, such as a reduction of hippocampal volume. Hippocampal volume is heritable, may explain a variety of cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia and is thus considered an intermediate phenotype for this mental illness. The aim of our analyses was to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) related to hippocampal volume without making prior assumptions about possible candidate genes. In this study, we combined genetics, imaging and neuropsychological data obtained from the Mind Clinical Imaging Consortium study of schizophrenia (n = 328). A total of 743,591 SNPs were tested for association with hippocampal volume in a genome-wide association study. Gene expression profiles of human hippocampal tissue were investigated for gene regions of significantly associated SNPs. None of the genetic markers reached genome-wide significance. However, six highly correlated SNPs (rs4808611, rs35686037, rs12982178, rs1042178, rs10406920, rs8170) on chromosome 19p13.11, located within or in close proximity to the genes NR2F6, USHBP1, and BABAM1, as well as four SNPs in three other genomic regions (chromosome 1, 2 and 10) had p-values between 6.75×10(-6) and 8.3×10(-7). Using existing data of a very recently published GWAS of hippocampal volume and additional data of a multicentre study in a large cohort of adolescents of European ancestry, we found supporting evidence for our results. Furthermore, allelic differences in rs4808611 and rs8170 were highly associated with differential mRNA expression in the cis-acting region. Associations with memory functioning indicate a possible functional importance of the identified risk variants. Our findings provide new insights into the genetic architecture of a brain structure closely linked to schizophrenia. In silico replication, mRNA expression and cognitive data provide additional support for the relevance of our findings.

However, the observations remain contradictory. Discrepancies in the results have been attributed to several factors, and consideration of a smaller sample size is one of them. To reach a valid conclusion, we performed a meta-analysis of the genetic association between IRS-1 (rs1801278) and IRS-2 (rs1805097) polymorphism with a predisposition to T2D. Materials and Methods: The literature search was performed in different databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus. All relevant articles were screened and based in inclusion and exclusion criteria eligible reports were identified. Baseline characteristics, genotype and allele frequencies were extracted from the eligible reports. The meta-analysis was performed by comprehensive meta-analysis software v3.3.070 and odds ratios, 95% confidence interval and probability values were calculated to find out association of IRS-1 and IRS-2 polymorphisms with rhinitis. Results: A total of seven studies comprising 1287 cases and 1638 control were considered for the present meta-analysis for the association of IRS-1 (rs1801278) polymorphism with T2D, and no significant association was observed. For IRS-2 (rs1805097) polymorphism, data from eight cohorts (cases: 1824, controls: 1786) were considered. The heterozygous genetic comparison models revealed a significant protective association against T2D predisposition (p = 0.017, OR = 0.841, 95% CI = 0.729 to 0.970). The trial sequential analysis revealed the requirement of additional case-control studies to draw a definitive conclusion for IRS-1 polymorphism.

Totally 441 OA patients and 533 controls were recruited and their genotypes for mTOR-pathway-related gene variants were determined based on the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. Genetic risk scores (GRS) were calculated to evaluate the combined effect of these polymorphisms on OA risk. No significant differences were observed in genotypic and allelic frequencies of AKT rs1130233/REDD1 rs1053639 polymorphisms.

This single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) also showed significantly correlation with the Lequesne's index. Similarly, the IRS1 rs1801278 polymorphism increased the risk of OA among smokers, drinkers and individuals aged ≥60 years.

The status of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was detected in the control group. Genotype and allele frequency comparison of polymorphism between the two groups was performed by χ2 test, odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was used for the result expression about the association of FGFR2 polymorphisms with osteoporosis. Furthermore, the results were adjusted by clinical features via logistic regression analysis.Results: AA genotype and A allele of rs2420946 were significantly associated with the increased risk of osteoporosis development adjusted by clinical features (OR = 2.238, 95% CI = 1.055-4.746; OR = 1.482, 95% CI = 1.042-2.019).

The A allele is the risk allele for both rs2046210 (OR [95% CI] = 1.43 [1.14 - 1.78], P = 0.0015) and rs3803662 (OR [95% CI] = 1.45 [1.16 - 1.83], P = 0.001). We conclude that two polymorphisms, rs2046210 in ESR1 and rs3803662 in TNRC9, are associated with breast cancer risk in the Vietnamese population.",High

Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood samples of 1,001 patients with breast cancer and 1,006 controls (without breast cancer), and the rs2981582, rs35054928, rs2981578, and rs11200014 polymorphisms were analyzed using allele‑specific Kompetitive allele‑specific PCR™, and the χ2 or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare the genotype frequencies. There was no association between those SNPs and breast cancer in the studied cohort, although an association was identified between the C/C homozygote genotype for rs2981578 and invasive lobular carcinoma. These results show that genetic biomarkers of breast cancer risk in European populations are not necessarily associated with risk in sub‑Saharan African populations. African populations are more heterogenous than other populations, and the information from this population can help focus genetic risks of cancer in this understudied population.",High
rs2981582,37107577,Evaluation of the Association between FGFR2 Gene Polymorphisms and Breast Cancer Risk in the Bangladeshi Population.,"Breast cancer is considered the most frequent cause of mortality from malignancy among females. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene polymorphisms are highly related to the risk of breast cancer. However, no investigation has been carried out to determine the association of FGFR2 gene polymorphisms in the Bangladeshi population. Based on polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), this study was performed to evaluate the association of FGFR2 (rs1219648, rs2420946, and rs2981582) variants in 446 Bangladeshi women (226 cases and 220 controls). A significant association of the FGFR2 rs1219648 variant with breast malignancy was reported in additive model 1 (aOR = 2.87, p < 0.0001), additive model 2 (aOR = 5.62, p < 0.0001), the dominant model (aOR = 2.87, p < 0.0001), the recessive model (aOR = 4.04, p < 0.0001), and the allelic model (OR = 2.16, p < 0.0001). This investigation also explored the significant association of the rs2981582 variant with the risk of breast cancer in additive model 2 (aOR = 2. 60, p = 0.010), the recessive model (aOR = 2.47, p = 0.006), and the allelic model (OR = 1.39, p = 0.016). However, the FGFR2 rs2420946 polymorphism showed no association with breast cancer except in the overdominant model (aOR = 0.62, p = 0.048). Furthermore, GTT (p < 0.0001) haplotypes showed a correlation with breast cancer risk, and all variants showed strong linkage disequilibrium. Moreover, in silico gene expression analysis showed that the FGFR2 level was upregulated in BC tissues compared to healthy tissues.

Results: Our study determined that the G/A genotype of CETPrs708272 was associated with two-fold-decreased odds of ON development under the codominant (OR = 0.495;95%CI:0.256-0.959) and overdominant (OR = 0.501;95%CI:0.280-0.895) models. Also, each allele C at VEGFArs833068 was associated with 1.7-fold increased odds of ON development under the additive model (OR = 1.733;95%CI:1.148-2.615). Furthermore, IL6 rs1800795 G/G genotype was associated with increased odds of ON development under the codominant (OR = 2.869;95%CI:1.280-6.434) and recessive (OR = 2.315;95%CI:1.251-4.285) models. Conclusions: We revealed that the genotypes of CETPrs708272 G/A, IL6rs1800795 G/G, and each allele C at VEGFArs833068 were associated with ON. CETPrs708272 G/G genotype was associated with decreased by 62% odds of ON with MS development under the recessive (OR = 0.379;95%CI:0.155-0.929; p = .034) model.",High
rs2981582,31002855,Predictive accuracy of the breast cancer genetic risk model based on eight common genetic variants: The BACkSIDE study.,"Breast cancer (BC) development is caused by the interaction of environmental and genetic factors. At least 90 susceptible genetic variants with different population penetration and incidence have been associated with BC. This paper therefore analysed the individual discrimination power of 8 low penetrant common genetic variants and calculated the predictive accuracy of the genetic risk model. The study enrolled 171 women with developed breast cancer (57.06 ± 11.60 years) and 146 control subjects (50.24 ± 10.69 years). The genotyping was performed by high resolution melting method (HRM) and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and the Random Forest algorithm provided the ROC curve with AUC values. Significant association with BC was confirmed in 2 SNPs: rs2981582 FGFR2 and rs889312 MAP3K1, and the odds ratios of homozygotes with two risk alleles in both SNP's were higher than in heterozygotes with one mutant allele, as follows: FGFR2 TT: 1.953 (95%CI 1.014-3.834, p = 0.049), CT 1.771 (95%CI 1.088-2.899, p = 0.026) and MAP3K1 CC 2.894 (95%CI 1.028-9.566, p = 0.048), AC 1.760 (95%CI 1.108-2.813, p = 0.019).

However, because of the genetic heterogeneity, the role of these loci in non-European descent populations is still unclear. To evaluate the relationships between genetic variants in these regions identified by GWAS and breast cancer risk in Chinese women, we genotyped four common SNPs at 9p21(rs1011970 and rs10757278), 10p15 (rs2380205), and 10q22 (rs1250009) in a two-stage case-control study with a total of 1792 breast cancer cases and 1,867 controls. We found that rs1250009 at 10q22 was consistently associated with risk of breast cancer in stage 1 and stage 2, with a per-allele OR of 1.13 (95% CI 1.02-1.25) after two stages combined (P = 0.023). However, no significant associations were observed between the other three SNPs and breast cancer risk.

rs10993994,33122083,Validation of prostate cancer risk variants rs10993994 and rs7098889 by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing.,"GWAS have identified numerous SNPs associated with prostate cancer risk. One such SNP is rs10993994. It is located in the β-microseminoprotein (MSMB) promoter region, mediates MSMB prostate secretion levels, and is linked to mRNA expression changes in both MSMB and the adjacent gene NCOA4. In addition, our previous work showed a second SNP, rs7098889, is in positive linkage disequilibrium with rs10993994 and associated with MSMB expression independent of rs10993994. Here, we generate a series of clones with single alleles removed by double guide RNA (gRNA) mediated CRISPR/Cas9 deletions, through which we demonstrate that each of these SNPs independently and greatly alters MSMB expression in an allele-specific manner. We further show that these SNPs have no substantial effect on the expression of NCOA4. These data demonstrate that a single SNP can have a large effect on gene expression and illustrate the importance of functional validation studies to deconvolute observed correlations. The method we have developed is generally applicable to test any SNP for which a relevant heterozygous cell line is available. AUTHOR SUMMARY: In pursuing the underlying biological mechanism of prostate cancer pathogenesis, scientists utilized the existence of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human genome as genetic markers to perform large scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) and have so far identified more than a hundred prostate cancer risk variants. Such variants provide an unbiased and systematic new venue to study the disease mechanism, and the next big challenge is to translate these genetic associations to the causal role of altered gene function in oncogenesis. The majority of these variants are waiting to be studied and lots of them may act in oncogenesis through gene expression regulation. To prove the concept, we took rs10993994 and its linked rs7098889 as an example and engineered single cell clones by allelic-specific CRISPR/Cas9 deletion to separate the effect of each allele. We observed that a single nucleotide difference would lead to surprisingly high level of MSMB gene expression change in a gene specific and cell-type specific manner. Our study strongly supports the notion that differential level of gene expression caused by risk variants and their associated genetic locus play a major role in oncogenesis and also highlights the importance of studying the function of MSMB encoded β-MSP in prostate cancer pathogenesis.","cancer, disease","Validation of prostate cancer risk variants rs10993994 and rs7098889 by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing.

Here, we investigated the population structure of 68 previously reported GWAS loci and calculated genetic disparity contribution statistics to identify SNPs that contribute the most to differences in prostate cancer risk across populations. By integrating GWAS results with allele frequency data, we generated genetic risk scores for 45 African and 19 non-African populations. Tests of natural selection were used to assess why some SNPs have large allele frequency differences across populations. We report that genetic predictions of prostate cancer risks are highest for West African men and lowest for East Asian men. These differences may be explained by the out-of-Africa bottleneck and natural selection.

While trans-eQTL scans suffer from high testing dimensionality, recent evidence indicates most trans-eQTL associations are mediated by cis-regulated genes, such as transcription factors. Leveraging a data-driven gene co-expression network, we conducted a comprehensive cis-mediator analysis using RNA-Seq data from 471 normal prostate tissue samples to identify downstream regulatory associations of previously identified prostate cancer risk variants. We discovered multiple trans-eQTL associations that were significantly mediated by cis-regulated transcripts, four of which involved risk locus 17q12, proximal transcription factor HNF1B, and target trans-genes with known HNF response elements (MIA2, SRC, SEMA6A, KIF12).

A total of 11 publications containing 13 case-control studies for rs10993994 polymorphism were included in our analysis. Our data indicated that MSMB gene rs10993994 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of PC. Stratification analyses of ethnicity suggested rs10993994 polymorphism increased the risk of PC among Caucasians, but not among Asians. In conclusion, this meta-analysis indicates that MSMB gene rs10993994 polymorphism increases the risk of PC.",High
rs10993994,26979803,Chromatin interactions and candidate genes at ten prostate cancer risk loci.,"Genome-wide association studies have identified more than 100 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with prostate cancer risk. However, the vast majority of these SNPs lie in noncoding regions of the genome. To test whether these risk SNPs regulate their target genes through long-range chromatin interactions, we applied capture-based 3C sequencing technology to investigate possible cis-interactions at ten prostate cancer risk loci in six cell lines. We identified significant physical interactions between risk regions and their potential target genes including CAPG at 2p11.2, C2orf43 at 2p24.1, RFX6 at 6q22.1, NFASC at 1q32.1, MYC at 8q24.1 and AGAP7P at 10q11.23. Most of the interaction peaks were co-localized to regions of active histone modification and transcription factor binding sites. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis showed suggestive eQTL signals at rs1446669, rs699664 and rs1078004 for CAPG (p < 0.004), rs13394027 for C2orf43 (p = 2.25E-27), rs10993994 and rs4631830 for AGAP7P (p < 8.02E-5). Further analysis revealed an enhancer activity at genomic region surrounding rs4631830 which was expected to disrupt HOXB-like DNA binding affinity.

rs10993994,26939004,Microseminoprotein-Beta Expression in Different Stages of Prostate Cancer.,"Microseminoprotein-beta (MSMB, MSMB) is an abundant secretory protein contributed by the prostate, and is implicated as a prostate cancer (PC) biomarker based on observations of its lower expression in cancerous cells compared with benign prostate epithelium. However, as the current literature on MSMB is inconsistent, we assessed the expression of MSMB at the protein and mRNA levels in a comprehensive set of different clinical stages of PC. Immunohistochemistry using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against MSMB was used to study protein expression in tissue specimens representing prostatectomies (n = 261) and in diagnostic needle biopsies from patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (n = 100), and in locally recurrent castration-resistant PC (CRPC) (n = 105) and CRPC metastases (n = 113). The transcript levels of MSMB, nuclear receptor co-activator 4 (NCOA4) and MSMB-NCOA4 fusion were examined by qRT-PCR in prostatectomy samples and by RNA-sequencing in benign prostatic hyperplasia, PC, and CRPC samples. We also measured serum MSMB levels and genotyped the single nucleotide polymorphism rs10993994 using DNA from the blood of 369 PC patients and 903 controls. MSMB expression in PC (29% of prostatectomies and 21% of needle biopsies) was more frequent than in CRPC (9% of locally recurrent CRPCs and 9% of CRPC metastases) (p<0.0001). Detection of MSMB protein was inversely correlated with the Gleason score in prostatectomy specimens (p = 0.024). The read-through MSMB-NCOA4 transcript was detected at very low levels in PC. MSMB levels in serum were similar in cases of PC and controls but were significantly associated with PC risk when adjusted for age at diagnosis and levels of free or total PSA (p<0.001). Serum levels of MSMB in both PC patients and controls were significantly associated with the rs10993994 genotype (p<0.0001).

With recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, many prostate cancer risk loci have been identified, including rs10993994, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located near the MSMB gene. Variant allele (T) carriers of this SNP produce less prostate secretory protein 94 (PSP94), the protein product of MSMB, and have an increased risk of prostate cancer (approximately 25% per T allele), suggesting that PSP94 plays a protective role in prostate carcinogenesis, although the mechanisms for such protection are unclear. METHODS. We reviewed the literature on possible mechanisms for PSP94 protection for prostate cancer. RESULTS. One possible mechanism is tumor suppression, as PSP94 has been observed to inhibit cell or tumor growth in in vitro and in vivo models. Another novel mechanism, which we propose in this review article, is that PSP94 may protect against prostate cancer by preventing or limiting an intracellular fungal infection in the prostate. This mechanism is based on the recent discovery of PSP94's fungicidal activity in low-calcium environments (such as the cytosol of epithelial cells), and accumulating evidence suggesting a role for inflammation in prostate carcinogenesis. We provide further details of our proposed mechanism in this review article. CONCLUSIONS. To explore this mechanism, future studies should consider screening prostate specimens for fungi using the rapidly expanding number of molecular techniques capable of identifying infectious agents from the entire tree of life.","tumor, cancer","MSMB variation and prostate cancer risk: clues towards a possible fungal etiology.

Calcium content of leaflets obtained in valve replacement surgeries was determined by micro-computed tomography. In the genotyping of 578 individuals, we found significant association between PALMD and IL6 polymorphisms and aortic stenosis in patients with tricuspid aortic valve, independently of other potentially confounding variables such as age and dyslipidemia. There was no association of these polymorphisms with valve calcium content, but this value correlated with the mean aortic pressure gradient (r = 0.44; P < 0.001). The CC genotype of IL6 polymorphism was associated with higher levels of serum IL-6 compared to other genotypes (23.5 vs. 10.5 pg/ml, respectively; P = 0.029).

MTR gene rs1805087 AG genotype distribution in the ECC group was clearly different from the control group (P = 0.029), and the ECC risk in cases with AG genotype was 0.525 times lower than those carrying AA genotype (95% CI = 0.292-0.942). Logistic regression analysis after adjustment for other clinical indicators determined that the MTR gene rs1805087 AG genotype was still strongly associated with susceptibility to ECC (OR = 0.499, 95% CI = 0.273-0.913, P = 0.024).

rs1801394,36467057,Identification of SNPs associated with methotrexate treatment outcomes in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis.,"Methotrexate is one of the cornerstones of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) therapy. Genetic factors or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are responsible for 15%-30% of the variation in drug response. Identification of clinically effective SNP biomarkers for predicting methotrexate (MTX) sensitivity has been a challenge. The aim of this study was to explore the association between the disease related outcome of MTX treatment and 23 SNPs in 8 genes of the MTX pathway, as well as one pro-inflammatory related gene in RA patients naïve to MTX. Categorical outcomes such as Disease Activity Score (DAS)-based European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) non-response at 4 months, The American College of Rheumatology and EULAR (ACR/EULAR) non-remission at 6 months, and failure to sustain MTX monotherapy from 12 to 24 months were assessed, together with continuous outcomes of disease activity, joint pain and fatigue.

Folate metabolism directly impacts nucleotide synthesis and methylation, which is of increasing interest in the reproductive medicine field. Studies assessing the genetic influence of folate metabolism on IVF treatments have currently been performed in women using their own oocytes. Most of these patients seeking to have a child or undergoing IVF treatments are advised to preventively intake folate supplies that restore known metabolic imbalances, but the treatments could lead to the promotion of specific enzymes in specific women, depending on their genetic variance. In the present study, we assess the influence of candidate gene variants related to folate metabolism, such as Serine Hydroxymethyltransferase 1 SHMT1 (rs1979276 and rs1979277), Betaine-Homocysteine S-Methyltransferase BHMT (rs3733890), Methionine synthase reductase MTRR (rs1801394), Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase MTHFR (rs1801131 and rs1801133), methionine synthase MTR (rs12749581), ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily B Member 1 ABCB1 (rs1045642) and folate receptor alpha FOLR1 (rs2071010) on the success of IVF treatment performed in women being recipients of donated oocytes.

We hypothesized that polymorphisms in genes involved in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics may explain this variation. A total of 151 individuals undergoing otorhinolaryngology surgery were included. The influence of genetic polymorphisms on sevoflurane sensitivity were investigated through SNaPshot technology. Individuals carrying KCNK2 rs6686529 G > C, MTRR rs3733784 TT, rs2307116 GG, or rs1801394 AA polymorphisms had a higher sensitivity to the sedative effect of sevoflurane than those without those polymorphisms. The univariate linear regression analysis indicated that MTRR rs3733784 TT, rs2307116 GG, and rs1801394 AA were potentially significant predictors of higher sensitivity to the sedative effect of sevoflurane. Moreover, CYP2E1 rs3813867 G > C and rs2031920 C > T, GABRG1 rs279858 T > C, KCNK3 rs1275988 CC, GRIN2B rs1806201 GG, MTRR rs2307116 G > A, and rs1801394 A > G were associated with a higher sensitivity to the cardiovascular effect of sevoflurane.

Systems based on single nucleotide polymorphisms for accurate prediction of iris, hair and skin color in global population, independent of bio-geographical ancestry, have recently been introduced. Here, we analyzed 14 SNPs for distinct skin pigmentation traits in a homogeneous cohort of 222 Polish subjects. We compared three different algorithms: General Linear Model based on logistic regression, Random Forest and Neural Network in 18 developed prediction models. We demonstrate Random Forest to be the most accurate algorithm for 3- and 4-category estimations (total of 58.3% correct calls for skin color prediction, 47.2% for tanning prediction, 50% for freckling prediction). Binomial Logistic Regression was the best approach in 2-category estimations (total of 69.4% correct calls, AUC = 0.673 for tanning prediction; total of 52.8% correct calls, AUC = 0.537 for freckling prediction). Our study confirms the association of rs12913832 (HERC2) with all three skin pigmentation traits, but also variants associated solely with certain pigmentation traits, namely rs6058017 and rs4911414 (ASIP) with skin sensitivity to sun and tanning abilities, rs12203592 (IRF4) with freckling and rs4778241 and rs4778138 (OCA2) with skin color and tanning.

However, the relationship of other identified SNPs in PSCA with these diseases remains unclear. Herein, the association between PSCA SNPs and GMA among 195 Japanese individuals with H. pylori infection was evaluated. The definition of GMA or non-GMA was based on serum pepsinogen levels or endoscopic findings. Five tag PSCA SNPs were analyzed using PCR high-resolution melting curve analysis with nonlabelled probes.

The facile, low-cost colorimetric methods were promising but still suffered from low sensitivity or poor selectivity. Therefore, highly active colorimetric probes and DNA/signal amplification technologies are still in urgent need to be explored. Herein, a bimetallic nanozyme Fe2MoO4 NPs with excellent peroxidase-like activity were successfully synthesized as the colorimetric probe, combining with hybridization chain reaction (HCR) to analyze the PSCA rs2294008 (C > T) as a factor for risk prediction of bladder cancer. The absorbance variation and selectivity can then be amplified upon the HCR, which could lead to prolonged DNA length beyond the range of •OH action and double chain with more negative charge to occupy more TMB while repelling the negatively charged nanozyme. Under the optimized conditions, the as-proposed method can achieve sensitive detection of the DNA mutation in the concentration range of 25 pM to 4 nM and detection limit as low as 2 pM, which is superior or comparable to most previously reported colorimetric sensors. Moreover, the practicability of the sensor was verified via the application in serum samples, showing satisfactory accuracy and good reproducibility.","condition, cancer","Hybridization chain reaction-mediated Fe2MoO4 bimetallic nanozyme for colorimetric risk prediction of bladder cancer.

The first was a polymorphism (rs2294008) in prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), and the other was a polymorphism (rs4072037) in mucin 1 (MUC1). DNA methylation is associated with gastric cancer and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-induced gastritis, while hypermethylation of promoter CpG island (CGI) is a common characteristic of enlarged-fold gastritis induced by H. pylori, a risk factor of diffuse-type gastric cancer. We evaluated the association between PSCA and MUC1 polymorphisms with H. pylori--related promoter CGI methylation in the nonneoplastic gastric mucosa. PSCA rs2294008 C/T and MUC1 rs4072037 A/G polymorphisms were genotyped in 410 cancer-free subjects in relation to promoter CGI methylation status of three candidate genes, of which the methylation status is associated with H. pylori infection (IGF2, MYOD1, and SLC16A12).

The first was a polymorphism (rs2294008) in prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), and the other was a polymorphism (rs4072037) in mucin 1 (MUC1). DNA methylation is associated with gastric cancer and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-induced gastritis, while hypermethylation of promoter CpG island (CGI) is a common characteristic of enlarged-fold gastritis induced by H. pylori, a risk factor of diffuse-type gastric cancer. We evaluated the association between PSCA and MUC1 polymorphisms with H. pylori--related promoter CGI methylation in the nonneoplastic gastric mucosa. PSCA rs2294008 C/T and MUC1 rs4072037 A/G polymorphisms were genotyped in 410 cancer-free subjects in relation to promoter CGI methylation status of three candidate genes, of which the methylation status is associated with H. pylori infection (IGF2, MYOD1, and SLC16A12).

About 5% of childbearing women are globally affected by early pregnancy loss (EPL) and most of them experience recurrence (RPL). Epigenetic mechanisms and controlled inflammation are crucial for pregnancy maintenance and genetic predispositions may increase the risk affecting the maternal-fetal crosstalk.

We utilized 27 deeply phenotyped donor eyes (recovered within a 6 h postmortem interval time) from Caucasian donors (60-94 years) using a standardized published protocol. Significant findings were then validated in an independent set of well-characterized donor eyes (n = 85). There was limited overlap between DEGs and DSGs, suggesting distinct mechanisms at play in AMD pathophysiology. A greater number of previously reported AMD loci overlapped with DSGs compared to DEGs between disease states, and no DEG overlap with previously reported loci was found in the macular retina between disease states. Additionally, we explored allele-specific expression (ASE) in coding regions of previously reported AMD risk loci, uncovering a significant imbalance in C3 rs2230199 and CFH rs1061170 in the macular RPE/choroid for normal eyes and intermediate AMD (iAMD), and for CFH rs1061147 in the macular RPE/choroid for normal eyes and iAMD, and separately neovascular AMD (NEO).

In addition to age (p < 0.01), sex (p = 0.03), and type of vaccine (p < 0.0001), which partially accounted for the remarkable individual differences observed in the antibody levels and dynamics, interesting genetic determinants appeared as significant modifiers of both IgG and NAb responses among the selected genes investigated (TP53, rs1042522; APOE, rs7412/rs429358; ABO, rs657152; ACE2, rs2285666; HLA-A rs2571381/rs2499; CRP, rs2808635/rs876538; LZTFL1, rs35044562; OAS3, rs10735079; SLC6A20, rs11385942; CFH, rs1061170; and ACE1, ins/del, rs4646994). In detail, regression analysis and mean antibody level comparison yielded appreciable differences after genotype stratification (P1 and P2, respectively, for IgG and NAb distribution) in the whole cohort and/or in the mRNA-based vaccine in the following genes: TP53, rs1042522 (P1 = 0.03; P2 = 0.04); ABO, rs657152 (P1 = 0.01; P2 = 0.03); APOE, rs7412/rs429358 (P1 = 0.0018; P2 = 0.0002); ACE2, rs2285666 (P1 = 0.014; P2 = 0.009); HLA-A, rs2571381/rs2499 (P1 = 0.02; P2 = 0.03); and CRP, rs2808635/rs876538 (P1 = 0.01 and P2 = 0.09). Conclusion: High- or low-responsive subjects can be identified among healthy adult vaccinated subjects after targeted genetic screening. This suggests that favorable genetic backgrounds may support the progression of an effective vaccine-induced immune response, though no definite conclusions can be drawn on the real effectiveness ascribed to a specific vaccine or to the different extent of a genotype-driven humoral response. The interplay between data from the polygenic predictive markers and serological screening stratified by demogeographic information can help to recognize the individual humoral response, accounting for ethnic and geographical differences, in both COVID-19 and anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations.",High

To identify whether the measurement of plasma protein concentrations of CFH variants using the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) assay can determine the genotypes of CFH SNP rs1061170 and rs800292, 120 patients with AMD and 26 controls were included in this study. The number of cases were TT:TC:CC = 121:24:1 in CFH SNP Y402H and GG:AG:AA = 72:57:17 in CFH SNP I62V. Plasma concentrations of tryptic peptides were measured using the MRM assay, and tyrosine/histidine (Y/H) and valine/isoleucine (V/I) CFH variant protein ratios were obtained. To discriminate the genotypes by the plasma protein ratios, cut-off values were set for Y/H ratios (TT: > 4.428; TC: 1.00-4.428; CC: < 1.00) and V/I ratios (GG: > 1.09; AG: 0.0089-1.08; AA: < 0.0089). Correlation analysis revealed that the plasma CFH variant protein ratios and genotypes of CFH were exactly matched (100%) without overlap in the total patients and controls.

Our analysis suggests that the corresponding substitutions potentially reduce the C3b-inactivation efficiency and promote slower and weaker AP C3bBb pre-convertase assembly on virions.

Materials and Methods: The study included 111 patients with exudative AMD treated with intravitreal bevacizumab or ranibizumab injections. Response to therapy was assessed on the basis of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) measured every 4 weeks for 12 months. The control group included 58 individuals without AMD. The SNPs were genotyped by a real-time polymerase chain reaction in genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood samples. Results: The CC genotype in SNP rs1061170 of the CFH gene was more frequent in patients with AMD than in controls (p = 0.0058). It was also more common among the 28 patients (25.2%) with poor response to therapy compared with good responders (p = 0.0002). Poor responders, especially those without this genotype, benefited from switching to another anti-VEGF drug. At the last follow-up assessment, carriers of this genotype had significantly worse BCVA (p = 0.0350) and greater CRT (p = 0.0168) than noncarriers. TT genotype carriers showed improved BCVA (p = 0.0467) and reduced CRT compared with CC and CT genotype carriers (p = 0.0194). No associations with AMD or anti-VEGF therapy outcomes for SNP rs9332739 in the C2 gene and SNP rs2230199 in the C3 gene were found. Conclusions: The CC genotype for SNP rs1061170 in the CFH gene was associated with AMD in our population. Additionally, it promoted a poor response to anti-VEGF therapy. On the other hand, TT genotype carriers showed better functional and anatomical response to anti-VEGF therapy at 12 months than carriers of the other genotypes for this SNP.",,,Low

It is characterized by at least 6 diopters or axial length > 26 mm and, choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in 5 to 11% of cases. Ranibizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody fragment. It is an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drug used in the treatment of CNV. Many genetic polymorphisms have been associated with interindividual differences in the response to ranibizumab, but these associations were not yet assessed among patients with high myopia and CNV. We performed a retrospective study assessing the association of genetic polymorphisms with response to ranibizumab in patients with CNV secondary to high myopia (mCNV). We included genetic polymorphisms previously associated with the response to drugs used in CNV patients (bevacizumab, ranibizumab, aflibercept, and photodynamic therapy (PDT)). We also included genetic variants in the VEGFA gene. Based on our results, ARMS2 (rs10490924) and CFH (rs1061170) are associated with response to ranibizumab in high myopia patients; and, included VEGFA genetic polymorphisms are not associated with ranibizumab response in our population but might be related to a higher risk of CNV.",,,Low

Here, a comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted to combine eligible studies for a more accurate assessment of the pharmacogenetics of PBC in NSCLC patients. Methods: Relevant publications were searched in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases through 15 May 2021. Inclusion criteria for eligible publications include studies that reported genotype and allele frequencies of NSCLC patients treated with PBC, delineated by their treatment response (sensitive vs. resistant). Publications on cell lines or animal models, duplicate reports, and non-primary research were excluded. Epidemiological credibility of cumulative evidence was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and Venice criteria. Begg's and Egger's tests were used to assess publication bias. Cochran's Q-test and I2 test were used to calculate the odds ratio and heterogeneity value to proceed with the random effects or fixed-effects method. Venice criteria were used to assess the strength of evidence, replication methods and protection against bias in the studies. Results: A total of 121 publications comprising 29,478 subjects were included in this study, and meta-analyses were performed on 184 genetic variants. Twelve genetic variants from 10 candidate genes showed significant associations with PBC response in NSCLC patients with strong or moderate cumulative epidemiological evidence (increased risk: ERCC1 rs3212986, ERCC2 rs1799793, ERCC2 rs1052555, and CYP1A1 rs1048943; decreased risk: GSTM1 rs36631, XRCC1 rs1799782 and rs25487, XRCC3 rs861539, XPC rs77907221, ABCC2 rs717620, ABCG2 rs2231142, and CDA rs1048977).

Results: Patients with TA/AA genotype of CYP2E1 T>A polymorphism showed significantly poor response while those with GC/CC genotype of RAD51 G>C showed better response (p = 0.008, p = 0.014 respectively). Death was significantly higher in patients with GG genotypes of RAD51 G>C and XRCC1 G>A (p = 0.006, p = 0.002 respectively).

Depending on the site of acquisition, pneumonia can be community acquired pneumonia (CAP) or nosocomial pneumonia (NP). The risk of pneumonia, is partially driven by host genetics. CYP1A1 is a widely studied pulmonary CYP family gene primarily expressed in peripheral airway epithelium. The CYP1A1 genetic variants, included in this study, alter the gene activity and are known to contribute in lung inflammation, which may cause pneumonia pathogenesis. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to establish the possible contribution of CYP1A1 gene, and its three variants (rs2606345, rs1048943 and rs4646903) towards the genetic etiology of pneumonia risk. Using PRISMA guidelines, we systematically reviewed and meta-analysed case-control studies, evaluating risk of pneumonia in patients carrying the risk alleles of CYP1A1 variants. Heterogeneity across the studies was evaluated using I2 statistics. Based on heterogeneity, a random-effect (using maximum likelihood) or fixed-effect (using inverse variance) model was applied to estimate the effect size. Pooled odds ratio (OR) was calculated to estimate the overall effect of the risk allele association with pneumonia susceptibility. Egger's regression test and funnel plot were used to assess publication bias. Subgroup analysis was performed based on pneumonia type (CAP and NP), population, as well as age group. A total of ten articles were identified as eligible studies, which included 3049 cases and 2249 healthy controls.

rs1048943,34163711,Universal and high-fidelity DNA single nucleotide polymorphism detection based on a CRISPR/Cas12a biochip.,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with many human diseases, so accurate and efficient SNP detection is of great significance for early diagnosis and clinical prognosis. This report proposes a universal and high-fidelity genotyping method in microfluidic point-of-care equipment based on the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) system. Briefly, by systematically inserting the protospacer-adjacent-motif (PAM) sequence, we improved the universality of the CRISPR/Cas12a based SNP detection; by removing the complementary ssDNA and introducing an additional nucleotide mismatch, we improved the sensitivity and specificity. We preloaded the CRISPR/Cas12a reagents into the point-of-care biochip for automating the process, increasing the stability and long-term storage. This biochip enables us to rapidly and conveniently detect the genotypes within 20 min. In a practical application, the CRISPR/Cas12a biochip successfully distinguished three genotypes (homozygous wild type; the homozygous mutant type; and the heterozygous mutant type) of the CYP1A1*2 (A4889G, rs1048943), CYP2C19*2 (G681A, rs4244285), CYP2C9*3 (A1075C, rs1057910), and CYP2C19*3 (G636A, rs4986893) genes related to multiple cancers from 17 clinical blood samples.

Genetic variants of DNA repair systems can reduce DNA repair capability and increase HCC risk. Objectives: This study aimed to examine, in Egyptian hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients, the relationship between the X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) rs1799782 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and HCC susceptibility. Methods: We included 100 adult HCV-positive patients with HCC and 100 adult HCV-positive patients with liver cirrhosis as pathological controls. XRCC1 rs1799782 SNP genotyping was done in both groups using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The distribution of genotypes in patients and controls was compared using several inheritance models. Results: We found that the CT genotype, when analyzed under both the co-dominant (OR (95 % CI): 2.147 (1.184-3.893), p = .012) and the over-dominant (OR (95 % CI): 2.055 (1.153-3.660), p = .015) models, as well as the combined CT and TT genotypes under the dominant model (OR (95 % CI) of 1.991 (1.133-3.497), p = .017), were associated with increased susceptibility to HCC. The frequency of the T allele was higher among HCC participants (32%) compared to those with cirrhosis (23.5%) and carrying the T allele increased the risk of HCC by 1.532 times, however, these associations did not reach statistical significance (p-values >0.05). Moreover, the variant T allele was associated with worse clinical manifestations and laboratory results among the HCC group, but AFP levels were not affected significantly.

Here, a comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted to combine eligible studies for a more accurate assessment of the pharmacogenetics of PBC in NSCLC patients. Methods: Relevant publications were searched in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases through 15 May 2021. Inclusion criteria for eligible publications include studies that reported genotype and allele frequencies of NSCLC patients treated with PBC, delineated by their treatment response (sensitive vs. resistant). Publications on cell lines or animal models, duplicate reports, and non-primary research were excluded. Epidemiological credibility of cumulative evidence was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and Venice criteria. Begg's and Egger's tests were used to assess publication bias. Cochran's Q-test and I2 test were used to calculate the odds ratio and heterogeneity value to proceed with the random effects or fixed-effects method. Venice criteria were used to assess the strength of evidence, replication methods and protection against bias in the studies. Results: A total of 121 publications comprising 29,478 subjects were included in this study, and meta-analyses were performed on 184 genetic variants. Twelve genetic variants from 10 candidate genes showed significant associations with PBC response in NSCLC patients with strong or moderate cumulative epidemiological evidence (increased risk: ERCC1 rs3212986, ERCC2 rs1799793, ERCC2 rs1052555, and CYP1A1 rs1048943; decreased risk: GSTM1 rs36631, XRCC1 rs1799782 and rs25487, XRCC3 rs861539, XPC rs77907221, ABCC2 rs717620, ABCG2 rs2231142, and CDA rs1048977).

The influence of genetic susceptibility on DNA damage and oxidative stress and the possible modulation of gene expression have not yet been investigated upon occupational exposure to waste anesthetic gases (WAGs). This study assessed 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) gene expression, which are related to oxidized DNA repair and antioxidant capacity, respectively, and the influence of their polymorphisms (OGG1 rs1052133 and SOD2 rs4880) in 100 professionals highly exposed to WAGs and 93 unexposed volunteers (control group). Additionally, X-ray repair cross complementing 1 (XRCC1 rs25487 and rs1799782) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM rs600931) gene polymorphisms as well as genetic instability (micronucleus-MN and nuclear bud-NBUD) and oxidative stress (malondialdehyde-MDA and ferric reducing antioxidant power-FRAP) biomarkers were assessed in the groups (control and exposed) and in the subgroups of the exposed group according to job occupation (anesthesiologists versus surgeons/technicians). Except for the ATM TT controls (associated with increased FRAP), there were no influences of OGG1, XRCC1, ATM, and SOD2 polymorphisms on MN, NBUD, MDA, and FRAP values in exposed or control subjects. No significant difference in the expression of either gene evaluated (OGG1 and SOD2) was found between the exposed and control groups. Increased OGG1 expression was observed among OGG1 -/Cys individuals only in the control group. Among the exposed group, anesthesiologists had a greater duration of WAG exposure (both h/week and years) than surgeons/technicians, which was associated with increased MDA and decreased antioxidant capacity (FRAP) and SOD2 expression (redox status). Higher expression of OGG1 was found in -/Cys surgeons/technicians than in anesthesiologists with the same genotype. Increased antioxidant capacity was noted in the surgeons/technicians carrying the ATM T allele and in those carrying XRCC1 -/Gln. Increased MN was influenced by OGG1 -/Cys in surgeons/technicians. Anesthesiologists with ATM CC exhibited increased MN, and those carrying the C allele (CC/CT genotype) exhibited increased NBUD. SOD2 polymorphism did not seem to be relevant for WAG exposure. These findings contribute to advancing the knowledge on genetic susceptibility/gene expression/genetic instability/oxidative stress, including differences in job occupation considering the workload, in response to occupational exposure to WAGs.",,,Low

Additionally, the rs25487 and rs3213245 SNPs in the XRCC1 gene, in both co-dominant and dominant models, were significantly associated with PLT count in AML (p < 0.05). The GG genotype of rs1130409 in APEX1 was more prone to adverse cytogenetics in both the codominant and recessive models (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the GA genotypes of ERCC8 rs158572 in codominant model was significantly correlated with refractory group (p < 0.05). ERCC8 rs158572 and XRCC1 rs3213245 in both codominant and dominant models were significantly correlated with the MRD positivity (p < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed an link between overall survival (OS) and the co-dominant, dominant, and recessive models of rs2228001 in XPC. Additionally, patients with the GG and GT/GG genotype in the co-dominant, dominant model and recessive model in XPC rs2228001 exhibited significantly longer survival (p < 0.05). Multivariate Cox analyses indicated that rs2228001 in both co-dominant and dominant models were independent favorable factors impacting patient OS (OR < 1). Our findings suggest that genetic polymorphisms in DNA excision repair pathway genetic polymorphisms contribute to the chemosensitivity and prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia.",,,Low
rs25487,38450253,Genetic Variants Associated With Response to Platinum-Based Chemotherapy in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients: A Field Synopsis and Meta-Analysis.,"Background: Publications on the associations of genetic variants with the response to platinum-based chemotherapy (PBC) in NSCLC patients have surged over the years, but the results have been inconsistent. Here, a comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted to combine eligible studies for a more accurate assessment of the pharmacogenetics of PBC in NSCLC patients. Methods: Relevant publications were searched in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases through 15 May 2021. Inclusion criteria for eligible publications include studies that reported genotype and allele frequencies of NSCLC patients treated with PBC, delineated by their treatment response (sensitive vs. resistant). Publications on cell lines or animal models, duplicate reports, and non-primary research were excluded. Epidemiological credibility of cumulative evidence was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and Venice criteria. Begg's and Egger's tests were used to assess publication bias. Cochran's Q-test and I2 test were used to calculate the odds ratio and heterogeneity value to proceed with the random effects or fixed-effects method. Venice criteria were used to assess the strength of evidence, replication methods and protection against bias in the studies. Results: A total of 121 publications comprising 29,478 subjects were included in this study, and meta-analyses were performed on 184 genetic variants. Twelve genetic variants from 10 candidate genes showed significant associations with PBC response in NSCLC patients with strong or moderate cumulative epidemiological evidence (increased risk: ERCC1 rs3212986, ERCC2 rs1799793, ERCC2 rs1052555, and CYP1A1 rs1048943; decreased risk: GSTM1 rs36631, XRCC1 rs1799782 and rs25487, XRCC3 rs861539, XPC rs77907221, ABCC2 rs717620, ABCG2 rs2231142, and CDA rs1048977). Bioinformatics analysis predicted possible damaging or deleterious effects for XRCC1 rs1799782 and possible low or medium functional impact for CYP1A1 rs1048943.

rs25487,38065035,Modulation of gene expression and influence of gene polymorphisms related to genotoxicity and redox status on occupational exposure to inhaled anesthetics.,"The extensive use of inhalational anesthetics contributes to both indoor and outdoor (environmental) pollution. The influence of genetic susceptibility on DNA damage and oxidative stress and the possible modulation of gene expression have not yet been investigated upon occupational exposure to waste anesthetic gases (WAGs). This study assessed 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) gene expression, which are related to oxidized DNA repair and antioxidant capacity, respectively, and the influence of their polymorphisms (OGG1 rs1052133 and SOD2 rs4880) in 100 professionals highly exposed to WAGs and 93 unexposed volunteers (control group). Additionally, X-ray repair cross complementing 1 (XRCC1 rs25487 and rs1799782) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM rs600931) gene polymorphisms as well as genetic instability (micronucleus-MN and nuclear bud-NBUD) and oxidative stress (malondialdehyde-MDA and ferric reducing antioxidant power-FRAP) biomarkers were assessed in the groups (control and exposed) and in the subgroups of the exposed group according to job occupation (anesthesiologists versus surgeons/technicians). Except for the ATM TT controls (associated with increased FRAP), there were no influences of OGG1, XRCC1, ATM, and SOD2 polymorphisms on MN, NBUD, MDA, and FRAP values in exposed or control subjects. No significant difference in the expression of either gene evaluated (OGG1 and SOD2) was found between the exposed and control groups. Increased OGG1 expression was observed among OGG1 -/Cys individuals only in the control group. Among the exposed group, anesthesiologists had a greater duration of WAG exposure (both h/week and years) than surgeons/technicians, which was associated with increased MDA and decreased antioxidant capacity (FRAP) and SOD2 expression (redox status). Higher expression of OGG1 was found in -/Cys surgeons/technicians than in anesthesiologists with the same genotype. Increased antioxidant capacity was noted in the surgeons/technicians carrying the ATM T allele and in those carrying XRCC1 -/Gln. Increased MN was influenced by OGG1 -/Cys in surgeons/technicians. Anesthesiologists with ATM CC exhibited increased MN, and those carrying the C allele (CC/CT genotype) exhibited increased NBUD. SOD2 polymorphism did not seem to be relevant for WAG exposure. These findings contribute to advancing the knowledge on genetic susceptibility/gene expression/genetic instability/oxidative stress, including differences in job occupation considering the workload, in response to occupational exposure to WAGs.",,,Low

The risk of malignant neoplasms among patients with RA is the subject of ongoing research due to the autoimmune pathogenesis that underlies RA, the common etiology of rheumatic disease and malignancies, and the use of immunomodulatory therapy, which can alter immune system function and thus increase the risk of malignant neoplasms. This risk can also be increased by impaired DNA repair efficiency in individuals with RA, as reported in our recent study. Impaired DNA repair may reflect the variability in the genes that encode DNA repair proteins. The aim of our study was to evaluate the genetic variation in RA within the genes of the DNA damage repair system through base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), and the double strand break repair system by homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).

rs25487,36725786,The Incidence of the XRCC1 rs25487 and PON1 rs662 Polymorphisms in a Population from Central Brazil: Patterns in an Area with a High Level of Agricultural Activity.,"In Brazil, high levels of agricultural activity are reflected in the consumption of enormous amounts of pesticides. The production of grain in Brazil has been estimated at 289.8 million tons in the 2022 harvest, an expansion of 14.7% compared with 2021. These advances are likely associated with a progressive increase in the occupational exposure of a population to pesticides. The Paraoxonase 1 gene (PON1) is involved in liver detoxification; the rs662 variant of this gene modifies the activity of the enzyme. The repair of pesticide-induced genetic damage depends on the protein produced by the X-Ray Repair Cross-Complementing Group 1 gene (XRCC). Its function is impaired due to an rs25487 variant. The present study describes the frequencies of the rs662 and rs25487 and their haplotypes in a sample population from Goiás, Brazil. It compares the frequencies with other populations worldwide to verify the variation in the distribution of these SNPs, with 494 unrelated individuals in the state of Goiás. The A allele of the rs25487 variant had a frequency of 26% in the Goiás population, and the modified rs662 G allele had a frequency of 42.8%. Four haplotypes were recorded for the rs25487 (G > A) and rs662 (A > G) markers, with a frequency of 11.9% being recorded for the A-G haplotype (both modified alleles), 30.8% for the G-G haplotype, 14.3% for the A-A haplotype, and 42.8% for the G-A haplotype (both wild-type alleles). We demonstrated the distribution of important SNPs associated with pesticide exposure in an area with a high agricultural activity level, Central Brazil.",,,Low

rs25487,36669817,Genotoxic effects of occupational exposure to glass fibres - A human biomonitoring study.,"As part of a large human biomonitoring study, we conducted occupational monitoring in a glass fibre factory in Slovakia. Shopfloor workers (n = 80), with a matched group of administrators in the same factory (n = 36), were monitored for exposure to glass fibres and to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The impact of occupational exposure on chromosomal aberrations, DNA damage and DNA repair, immunomodulatory markers, and the role of nutritional and lifestyle factors, as well as the effect of polymorphisms in metabolic and DNA repair genes on genetic stability, were investigated. The (enzyme-modified) comet assay was employed to measure DNA strand breaks (SBs) and apurinic sites, oxidised and alkylated bases. Antioxidant status was estimated by resistance to H2O2-induced DNA damage. Base excision repair capacity was measured with an in vitro assay (based on the comet assay). Exposure of workers to fibres was low, but still was associated with higher levels of SBs, and SBs plus oxidised bases, and higher sensitivity to H2O2. Multivariate analysis showed that exposure increased the risk of high levels of SBs by 20%. DNA damage was influenced by antioxidant enzymes catalase and glutathione S-transferase (measured in blood). DNA repair capacity was inversely correlated with DNA damage and positively with antioxidant status. An inverse correlation was found between DNA base oxidation and the percentage of eosinophils (involved in the inflammatory response) in peripheral blood of both exposed and reference groups. Genotypes of XRCC1 variants rs3213245 and rs25487 significantly decreased the risk of high levels of base oxidation, to 0.50 (p = 0.001) and 0.59 (p = 0.001), respectively. Increases in DNA damage owing to glass fibre exposure were significant but modest, and no increases were seen in chromosome aberrations or micronuclei. However, it is of concern that even low levels of exposure to these fibres can cause significant genetic damage.",,,Low

However, its clinical efficacy is largely limited by individual variations in radio-sensitivity and radiotherapy-associated toxicity. There is an urgent need to identify genetic determinants that can explain patients' likelihood to develop recurrence and radiotherapy-associated toxicity following CRT. In this study, we performed comprehensive genomic profiling, using a 474-cancer- and radiotherapy-related gene panel, on pretreatment biopsy samples from patients with unresectable stage III NSCLCs who underwent definitive CRT. Patients' baseline clinical characteristics and genomic features, including tumor genetic, genomic and molecular pathway alterations, as well as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), were correlated with progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and radiotherapy-associated pneumonitis and/or esophagitis development after CRT. A total of 122 patients were enrolled between 2014 and 2019, with 84 (69%) squamous cell carcinomas and 38 (31%) adenocarcinomas. Genetic analysis confirmed the association between the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway gene alterations and unfavorable survival outcome, and revealed alterations in FGFR family genes, MET, PTEN, and NOTCH2 as potential novel and independent risk factors of poor post-CRT survival. Combined analysis of such alterations led to improved stratification of the risk populations. In addition, patients with EGFR activating mutations or any oncogenic driver mutations exhibited improved OS. On the other hand, we also identified genetic markers in relation to radiotherapy-associated thoracic toxicity.

Moreover, through their roles in genome integrity and replicative fidelity, somatic alterations in ZNF217 and POLD1 might also serve as risk predictors of high-grade pneumonitis and esophagitis. Taken together, leveraging targeted next-generating sequencing, we identified a set of novel clinically applicable biomarkers that might enable prediction of survival outcomes and risk of radiotherapy-associated thoracic toxicities.

Of them, there were 15 studies with 5873 cases and 5771 controls for rs1805388 and 6 studies with 4161 cases and 4881 controls for rs1805386. Overall, our results suggested that there was no obvious relevance of LIG4 T9I polymorphism with cancer susceptibility. However, in subgroup analysis, we found the LIG4 T9I was associated with a slightly decreased cancer risk among Caucasians. As to the rs1805386, the genetic variant had no significant association with cancer risk. In conclusion, despite several limitations, this meta-analysis suggested that LIG4 T9I genetic variant is associated with a decreased risk of cancer among Caucasians, however, the rs1805386 gene polymorphism is not a risk factor of cancer.",High

rs1805386,21974800,DNA repair gene polymorphisms and risk of early onset colorectal cancer in Lynch syndrome.,"DNA repair plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic integrity with over 130 genes involved in various repair pathways that include base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, double strand break repair and DNA mismatch repair. Polymorphisms within genes that are involved in these processes have been widely reported to be associated with cancer susceptibility in an extensive range of malignancies that include colorectal cancer (CRC). Lynch syndrome is caused by inherited germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, predominantly in MLH1 and MSH2, that predispose to a variety of epithelial malignancies, most notably CRC. Despite being a relatively well understood hereditary cancer syndrome there remain several questions in relation to genetic influences on disease expression. Since Lynch syndrome is associated with a breakdown in DNA mismatch repair variation in other DNA repair genes may influence disease expression. In this report we have genotyped 424 Australian and Polish Lynch syndrome participants for eight common DNA repair gene polymorphisms to assess any association with the age of CRC onset. The DNA repair gene SNPs included in the study were: BRCA2 (rs11571653), MSH3 (rs26279), Lig4 (rs1805386), OGG1 (rs1052133), XRCC1 (rs25487), XRCC2 (rs3218536 and rs1799793) and XRCC3 (rs861539). Cox multi-variant regression modelling failed to provide any convincing evidence of an effect in any of the polymorphisms analysed.

Moreover, allele rs2736100 T was also found to be less common in patients with disease progression in response to treatment. hTERT rs2853690 T was associated with higher haemoglobin blood levels and lower C-reactive protein. In conclusion, our results suggest that telomere length and hTERT genetic variability may affect MM development and can be potential prognostic markers in this disease. Telomere dysfunction is a notable event observed in many cancers contributing to their genomic instability. A major factor controlling telomere stability is the human telomerase reverse transcriptase catalytic subunit (hTERT). Telomere shortening has been observed in multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell malignancy with a complex and heterogeneous genetic background. In the present study, we aimed to analyse telomere length and hTERT genetic variants as potential markers of risk and survival in 251 MM patients. We found that telomere length was significantly shorter in MM patients than in healthy individuals, and patients with more advanced disease (stage III according to the International Staging System) had shorter telomeres than patients with less advanced disease. MM patients with hTERT allele rs2736100 T were characterized with significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS).

rs2736100,36497039,Parental Genetics Communicate with Intrauterine Environment to Reprogram Newborn Telomeres and Immunity.,"Telomeres, markers for cellular senescence, have been found substantially influenced by parental inheritance. It is well known that genomic stability is preserved by the DNA repair mechanism through telomerase. This study aimed to determine the association between parents−newborn telomere length (TL) and telomerase gene (TERT), highlighting DNA repair combined with TL/TERT polymorphism and immunosenescence of the triad. The mother−father−newborn triad blood samples (n = 312) were collected from Ziauddin Hospitals, Pakistan, between September 2021 and June 2022. The telomere length (T/S ratio) was quantified by qPCR, polymorphism was identified by Sanger sequencing, and immunosenescence by flow cytometry. The linear regression was applied to TL and gene association. The newborns had longest TL (2.51 ± 2.87) and strong positive association (R = 0.25, p ≤ 0.0001) (transgenerational health effects) with mothers’ TL (1.6 ± 2.00). Maternal demographics—socioeconomic status, education, and occupation—showed significant effects on TL of newborns (p < 0.015, 0.034, 0.04, respectively). The TERT risk genotype CC (rs2736100) was predominant in the triad (0.6, 0.5, 0.65, respectively) with a strong positive association with newborn TL (β = 2.91, <0.0011). Further analysis highlighted the expression of KLRG 1+ in T-cells with shorter TL but less frequent among newborns. The study concludes that TERT, parental TL, antenatal maternal health, and immunity have a significantly positive effect on the repair of newborn TL.",,,Low

It is characterized by repeated upper airway collapses during sleep. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is involved in the prevention of telomere shortening. This prospective, observational study aimed to investigate the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TERT and the severity of OSA, taking into account hypertension and diabetes prevalence. Methods: A total of 149 patients with OSA were diagnosed using one-night video-polysomnography based on the American Academy of Sleep Medicine guidelines. The TERT SNPs and telomere length (TL) were detected using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: Statistical analysis showed that there is no relationship between the rs2853669 and rs2736100 polymorphisms of TERT, and the severity of OSA (p > 0.05). Moreover, no relationship between TL and the severity of OSA was observed.

rs2853669,38136323,"Association of MGMT Promoter and Enhancer Methylation with Genetic Variants, Clinical Parameters, and Demographic Characteristics in Glioblastoma.","The response of glioblastoma (GBM) patients to the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) vitally depends on the expression level of the repair protein O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Since MGMT is strongly regulated by promoter methylation, the methylation status of the MGMT promoter has emerged as a prognostic and predictive biomarker for GBM patients. By determining the methylation levels of the four enhancers located within or close to the MGMT gene, we recently found that enhancer methylation contributes to MGMT regulation. In this study, we investigated if methylation of the four enhancers is associated with SNP rs16906252, TERT promoter mutations C228T and C250T, TERT SNP rs2853669, proliferation index Ki-67, overall survival (OS), age, and sex of the patients. In general, associations with genetic variants, clinical parameters, and demographic characteristics were caused by a complex interplay of multiple CpGs in the MGMT promoter and of multiple CpGs in enhancer regions. The observed associations for intragenic enhancer 4, located in intron 2 of MGMT, differed from associations observed for the three intergenic enhancers. Some findings were restricted to subgroups of samples with either methylated or unmethylated MGMT promoters, underpinning the relevance of the MGMT promoter status in GBMs.",,,Low

This prospective, observational study aimed to investigate the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TERT and the severity of OSA, taking into account hypertension and diabetes prevalence. Methods: A total of 149 patients with OSA were diagnosed using one-night video-polysomnography based on the American Academy of Sleep Medicine guidelines. The TERT SNPs and telomere length (TL) were detected using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: Statistical analysis showed that there is no relationship between the rs2853669 and rs2736100 polymorphisms of TERT, and the severity of OSA (p > 0.05). Moreover, no relationship between TL and the severity of OSA was observed.

rs2853669,34858826,Large Multicohort Study Reveals a Prostate Cancer Susceptibility Allele at 5p15 Regulating TERT via Androgen Signaling-Orchestrated Chromatin Binding of E2F1 and MYC.,"Aberrant telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression is crucial for tumor survival and cancer cells escaping apoptosis. Multiple TERT-locus variants at 5p15 have been discovered in association with cancer risk, yet the underlying mechanisms and clinical impacts remain unclear. Here, our association studies showed that the TERT promoter variant rs2853669 confers a risk of prostate cancer (PCa) in different ethnic groups. Further functional investigation revealed that the allele-specific binding of MYC and E2F1 at TERT promoter variant rs2853669 associates with elevated level of TERT in PCa. Mechanistically, androgen stimulations promoted the binding of MYC to allele T of rs2853669, thereby activating TERT, whereas hormone deprivations enhanced E2F1 binding at allele C of rs2853669, thus upregulating TERT expression. Notably, E2F1 could cooperate with AR signaling to regulate MYC expression. Clinical data demonstrated synergistic effects of MYC/E2F1/TERT expression or with the TT and CC genotype of rs2853669 on PCa prognosis and severity. Strikingly, single-nucleotide editing assays showed that the CC genotype of rs2853669 obviously promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the development of castration-resistant PCa (CRPC), confirmed by unbiased global transcriptome profiling. Our findings thus provided compelling evidence for understanding the roles of noncoding variations coordinated with androgen signaling and oncogenic transcription factors in mis-regulating TERT expression and driving PCa.","tumor, cancer","Large Multicohort Study Reveals a Prostate Cancer Susceptibility Allele at 5p15 Regulating TERT via Androgen Signaling-Orchestrated Chromatin Binding of E2F1 and MYC.

rs2853669,34857839,TERT genetic variability and telomere length as factors affecting survival and risk in acute myeloid leukaemia.,"Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a neoplasm of immature myeloid cells characterized by various cytogenetic alterations. The present study showed that in addition to the FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutation status, telomere length (TL) and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene polymorphisms may affect risk and overall survival (OS) in AML. TL was longer in healthy controls than in AML patients and positively correlated with age in the patients, but not in healthy subjects. TL was found to be independently affected by the presence of the FLT3-ITD mutation. As for the TERT gene polymorphism, AML patients with the TERT rs2853669 CC genotype were characterized by significantly shorter OS than patients carrying the T allele. Another observation in our study is the difference in TL and OS in patients belonging to various risk stratification groups related to the FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutation status. Patients with adverse risk classification (mutation in FLT3-ITD and lack of mutation in NPM1) presented with the shortest telomeres and significantly worse OS. In conclusion, OS of AML patients appears to be affected by TERT gene variability and TL in addition to other well-established factors such as age, WBC count, or FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutation status.",,,Low

Although four of them, A3A, A3B, A3F and A3G, are induced by type-1-interferon (IFN-I), their role in inflammatory conditions is unknown. We thus investigated the expression of A3, and particularly A3A and A3B because of their ability to edit cellular DNA, in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by high IFN-α serum levels. In a cohort of 57 SLE patients, A3A and A3B, but also A3C and A3G, were upregulated ~ 10 to 15-fold (> 1000-fold for A3B) compared to healthy controls, particularly in patients with flares and elevated serum IFN-α levels. Hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids and immunosuppressive treatment did not reverse A3 levels. The A3AΔ3B polymorphism, which potentiates A3A, was detected in 14.9% of patients and in 10% of controls, and was associated with higher A3A mRNA expression. A3A and A3B mRNA levels, but not A3C or A3G, were correlated positively with dsDNA breaks and negatively with lymphopenia. Exposure of SLE PBMCs to IFN-α in culture induced massive and sustained A3A levels by 4 h and led to massive cell death. Furthermore, the rs2853669 A > G polymorphism in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter, which disrupts an Ets-TCF-binding site and influences certain cancers, was highly prevalent in SLE patients, possibly contributing to lymphopenia. Taken together, these findings suggest that high baseline A3A and A3B levels may contribute to cell frailty, lymphopenia and to the generation of neoantigens in SLE patients. Targeting A3 expression could be a strategy to reverse cell death and the generation of neoantigens.","condition, cancer, disease","APOBEC3 (A3) enzymes are best known for their role as antiviral restriction factors and as mutagens in cancer.

The purpose of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the relationship between BRCA1 polymorphisms (rs799917, rs1799950, rs1799966, or rs16941) and cancer risk. Relevant studies were identified via a systematic search of the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases up to July 31, 2017. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to examine the strength of the associations. Thirty-five studies published in 19 publications involving 28,094 cases and 50,657 controls were included in this meta-analysis. There was no obvious association between rs799917, rs1799966, or rs16941 polymorphisms and overall cancer risk in any genetic models. However, subgroup analyses revealed that the rs799917 polymorphism could decrease the risk of cervical cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), gastric cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) among Asian populations in one or more genetic models and that rs16941 could increase overall cancer risk among Caucasian populations in the homozygote and recessive models. Our meta-analysis also indicated that rs1799950 could decrease the breast cancer (BC) risk among Caucasian populations in the homozygote and recessive models.

However, the correlations between BRCA1/2 polymorphism and pancreatic cancer prognosis remained unknown. In this study, we genotyped three tag missense variants on BRCA1/2 in 603 sporadic pancreatic cancer patients in a Chinese population. We found rs1799966 on BRCA1 was associated with poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients with hazard ratio being 1.23 (95% CI: 1.09-1.40, P = 0.0010). Further stratification analyses showed that significant correlation was particularly in locally advanced stage patients with hazard ratio being 1.36 (95% CI: 1.13-1.64, P = 0.0014), but not in patients in local stage (P = 0.1139) or metastatic stage (P = 0.5185).

On the other hand, among sMTC patients, the T-allele of p.Leu769 = was less frequent (OR = 0.70 [CI 0.58-0.84], p = 1.9 × 10-4) and rare homozygotes TT showed an OR = 0.32 ([CI 0.17-0.60], p = 2.3 × 10-4). Moreover, a statistically significant excess of the haplotype 2 (characterized by the alleles T-G-G-C-C of the listed SNPs) was observed (p = 3.9 × 10-3). The SNPs were not associated with the expression of RET mRNA, that is, they did not exert an effect in cis as quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL). However, a strong eQTL association was found for p.Leu769 = and the neighboring gene CSGALNACT2 (p = 9.3 × 10-50; effect-size = -0.65), whose function in cancer is unknown. Conclusions: This study shows that specific RET haplotypes, in particular haplotype 2 and the T-allele of p.Leu769 = , are associated with a reduced risk of sMTC in Italians.",High

To study the genetic causes of pVUR in Quebec patients, we used a sequencing-based candidate gene approach to screen the RET gene and found that 83 out of 118 pVUR patients are carriers of the rare A allele of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1799939:G>A that results in a Gly691Ser mutation, a statistically significant increase in allelic frequency, that is absent at six flanking RET SNPs tested. Ser691 is a predicted phosphorylation site and our analysis of transfected cells showed that the Gly691Ser Ret mutant can efficiently interact and associate with a 75-80-kD tyrosine phosphorylated cellular protein, an event not seen with wild-type Ret. This interaction and/or the steric or electric hindrance created by phospho-Ser691 may interfere with the known regulatory functions of the normally phosphorylated phospho-Tyr687 and phospho-Ser696 on the cytoskeleton actin reorganization that are responsible for cell motility and morphology, which consequently may lead to the deficiency in ureteral development observed in pVUR. Our study demonstrates that the Ret Gly691Ser mutation is associated with pVUR and may be one of the genetic causes of this condition in the French-Canadian population in Quebec.",condition,"Primary vesicoureteral reflux (pVUR) is a common, genetically heterogeneous congenital urinary tract abnormality in children.

Aurora kinase A (AURKA), a serine/threonine kinase, has a critical role in centrosome duplication, spindle assembly checkpoint, and cytokinesis. Here, we determined the correlation between UCC susceptibility and AURKA polymorphisms. We used real-time polymerase chain reaction to compare the genotype distributions and allelic frequencies of four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of AURKA, namely rs1047972, rs2273535, rs2064863, and rs6024836, between 431 UCC cases and 862 healthy controls. Logistic regression models demonstrated that the G allele of rs2064863, a genetic polymorphism of AURKA, exhibited a significant protective effect against UCC among the 862 nonsmokers. Moreover, patients with rs2064863 G allele exhibited a slightly lower risk of lymph node metastasis and those with rs6024836 G allele exhibited a lower risk of distant metastases. Our study suggested that several variants of AURKA SNPs rs2064863 and rs6024836 may serve as critical predictors for the clinical status of UCC.",,,Low

We also conducted a hospital-based case-control study involving 385 GC cases and 470 controls in a Chinese population to evaluate the role of AURKA gene rs2273535 polymorphism in the risk of GC. Genotyping was performed using a custom-by-design 48-Plex single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) Scan™ Kit. Co-expression analysis indicated that the overexpression of AURKA may be associated with poor prognosis of GC. In addition, TT genotypes of rs2273535 polymorphism increased the risk of GC by 72% compared to the AA genotypes. This significant correlation was also observed in the allelic and dominant models. The stratified analysis suggested that TT+AT genotypes showed positive correlation with the risk of GC among female, age <55 years group and non-smokers compared to AA genotypes. In conclusion, AURKA plays an important role in the development of GC. Larger studies with more diverse ethnic populations are needed to confirm these results.",High

In neuroblastoma, AURKA protein product regulates N-myc protein levels and plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. To investigate the association between three AURKA polymorphisms (rs1047972 C>T, rs2273535 T>A, and rs8173 G>C) and neuroblastoma susceptibility in Chinese populations, we performed this two-center case-control study including 393 neuroblastoma cases and 812 controls. Two study populations were recruited from two different regions in China. No significant associations were identified amongst any of the three AURKA polymorphisms and the risk of neuroblastoma. Similar observations were found in the stratified analysis. In conclusion, our results indicate that none of the AURKA polymorphisms are associated with neuroblastoma susceptibility in two distinct Chinese populations.

AURKA (aurora kinase A) is a mitotic serine/threonine kinase that functions as an oncogene and plays a critical role in hepatocarcinogenesis. We report on the association between 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the AURKA gene (rs1047972, rs2273535, rs2064836, and rs6024836) and HCC susceptibility as well as clinical outcomes in 312 patients with HCC and in 624 cancer-free controls. We found that carriers of the TT allele of the variant rs1047972 were at greater risk of HCC compared with wild-type (CC) carriers. Moreover, carriers of at least one A allele in rs2273535 were less likely to progress to stage III/IV disease, develop large tumors or be classified into Child-Pugh class B or C. Individuals with at least one G allele at AURKA SNP rs2064863 were at lower risk of developing large tumors or progressing to Child-Pugh grade B or C. Our results indicate that genetic variations in the AURKA gene may serve as an important predictor of early-stage HCC and be a reliable biomarker for the development of HCC.","tumor, cancer, disease","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a liver malignancy and a major cause of cancer mortality worldwide.

Results Carrier status for the minor allele of rs2273535 (T91A, p.
